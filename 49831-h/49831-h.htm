<span class="i4"><i>&quot;They are a couple of far-country</i></span>

<p class="indent">We stayed in Florence three days before
we started on our pilgrimage to Rome.
We needed a short rest. The railway journey
straight through from London had been unusually
tiresome because of our tricycle. From
the first mention of our proposed pilgrimage,
kind friends in England had warned us that on
the way to Italy the machine would be a burden
worse than the Old Man of the Sea; porters,
guards, and custom-house officials would
look upon it as lawful prey, and we should pay
more to get it to Italy than it had cost in the
beginning. It is wonderful how clever one&#39;s
friends are to discover the disagreeable, and
then how eager to point it out!</p>

Our first experience at the station at Holborn
Viaduct seemed to confirm their warnings.
We paid eight shillings to have the
tricycle carried to Dover, porters amiably remarking
it would take a pile of money to get
such a machine to Italy. Crossing the Channel,
we paid five-and-sixpence more, and the
sailors told us condolingly we should have an
awful time of it in the custom-house at Calais.
This, however, turned out a genuine seaman&#39;s
yarn. The tricycle was examined carefully,
but to be admired, not valued. &quot;That&#39;s well
made, that!&quot; one guard declared with appreciation,
and others playfully urged him to mount
it. To make a long story short, our friends
proved false prophets. From Calais to Florence
we paid only nine francs freight and
thirty-five francs duty at Chiasso. But unfortunately
we never knew what might be about
to happen. We escaped in one place only to
be sure the worst would befall us in the next.
It was not until the cause of our anxiety was
safe in Florence that our mental burden was
taken away.</p>

<p class="indent">But here were more friends who called our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
pilgrimage a desperate journey, and asked if
we had considered what we might meet with
in the way we were going. There was the
cholera. But we represented that to get to
Rome we should not go near the stricken
provinces. Then they persisted that our road
lay through valleys reeking with malaria until
November at least. We should not reach
these valleys before November, was our reply.
Well, then, did we know we must pass through
lonely districts where escaped convicts roamed
abroad; and in and out of villages where fleas
were like unto a plague of Egypt, and good
food as scarce as in the wilderness? In a word,
ours was a fool&#39;s errand. Perhaps it was because
so little had come of the earlier prophecies
that we gave slight heed to these. They
certainly made no difference in our plans. On
October 16, the third morning after our arrival,
we rode forth <i>sans</i> flea-powder or brandy,
<i>sans</i> quinine or beef-extract, <i>sans</i> everything
our friends counselled us to take,&mdash;and hence,
according to them, right into the jaws of
death.</p>

<h2>IN THE VAL D&#39;ARNO.</h2>

<span class="i4"><i>&quot;Now their way lay just upon the</i></span>

<span class="i4"><i>Christian and his companion walked</i></span>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The <i>padrone</i> who helped to strap our
portfolio and two bags to the luggage-carrier,
our coats to the handle-bars, and the
knapsack to J.&#39;s back, and Mr. Mead, the one
friend who foretold pleasure, stood at the door
of the Hotel Minerva to see us off. The
sunlight streamed over the Piazza of Santa
Maria Novella and the beggars on the church-steps
and the cabmen who good-naturedly
cried &quot;No carriage for you,&quot; as we wheeled
slowly on, over to the Via Tornabuoni,
past Doni&#39;s, by Viesseux&#39;s, up the Lung&#39;
Arno to the crowded Ponte Vecchio where for
this once at least we were not attacked by
the little shopmen, by the Via de&#39; Bardi, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
back through the Borgo San Jacopo, again
along the Lung&#39; Arno, and then around with
the twisting street-car tracks, through the Porta
San Frediano, and out on the broad white
road which leads to Pisa.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">But even before we left Florence we met
with our first accident. The luggage-carrier
swung around from the middle to the side
of the backbone. The one evil consequence,
however, was a half-hour&#39;s delay. Beyond
the gate we stopped at the first blacksmith&#39;s.
Had either of us known the Italian word for
&quot;wire,&quot; the delay might have been shorter. It
was only by elaborate pantomime we could
make our meaning clear. Then the blacksmith
took the matter in his own hands, unstrapped
the bags, and went to work with
screw-driver and wire, while the entire neighborhood,
backed by passing pedlers and street-car
drivers and citizens, pronounced the tricycle
&quot;beautiful!&quot; &quot;a new horse!&quot; &quot;a tramway!&quot;
When the luggage-carrier was fastened securely
and loaded again, the blacksmith was so proud
of his success that he declared &quot;nothing&quot; was
his charge.  But he was easily persuaded to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
take something to drink the <i>Signore&#39;s</i> health.
After this there were no further stops.</p>

<p class="indent">Our road for some distance went over streets
laid with the great stones of the old Tuscan
pavement,&mdash;and for tricyclers these streets are
not very bad going,&mdash;between tall gray houses,
with shrines built in them, and those high walls
which radiate from Florence in every direction,
and keep one from seeing the gardens and
green places within. Women plaiting straw,
great yellow bunches of which hung at their
waists, and children greeted us with shouts.
Shirtless bakers, their hands white with flour,
and barbers holding their razors, men with
faces half shaved and still lathered, and others
with wine-glasses to their lips, rushed to look
at this new folly of the foreigner,&mdash;for ours
was the first tandem tricycle ever seen in Italy.
At Signa, on the steep up-grade just outside
the town, we had a lively spurt with a dummy
engine, the engineer apparently trying to run
us down as we were about to cross the track.
After this we rode between olives and vineyards
where there were fewer people. There
was not a cloud in the sky, so blue overhead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
and so white above the far hill-tops on the
horizon. The wind in the trees rustled gently
in friendliness. Solemn, white-faced, broad-horned
oxen stared at us sympathetically over
the hedges. One young peasant even stopped
his cart to say how beautiful he thought it
must be to travel in Italy after our fashion.
All day we passed gray olive-gardens and
green terraced hillsides, narrow Tuscan-walled
streams dry at this season, and long rows of
slim straight poplars,&mdash;&quot;white trees,&quot; a woman
told us was their name. Every here and there
was a shrine with lamp burning before the
Madonna, or a wayside cross bearing spear
and scourge and crown of thorns. Now we
rode by the fair river of Arno, where reeds
grew tall and close by the water&#39;s edge, and
where the gray-green mountains rising almost
from its banks were barren of all trees save
dark stone-pines and towering cypresses, like
so many mountains in Raphael&#39;s or Perugino&#39;s
pictures. Now we came to where the plain
broadened and the mountains were blue and
distant. Mulberries the peasants had stripped
of their leaves before their time, but not bare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
because of the vines festooned about them,
broke with their even ranks the monotony of
gray and brown ploughed fields. Here on a
hill was a white villa or monastery, with long,
lofty avenue of cypresses; there, the stanch
unshaken walls and gates of castle or fortress,
which, however, had long since disappeared.
It is true, all these things are to be seen hastily
from the windows of the railway train; but it
is only by following the windings and straight
ways of the road as we did that its beauty can
be worthily realized.</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the afternoon, with a turn of the
road, we came suddenly in view of Capraia,
high up above, and far to the other side of the
river,&mdash;so far, indeed, that all detail was lost,
and we could only see the outline of its houses
and towers and campanile washed into the
whitish-blue sky. And all the time we were
working just hard enough to feel that joy of
mere living which comes with healthy out-of-door
exercise, and, I think, with nothing else.
Sometimes we rode seeing no one, and hearing
no other sound than the low cries of a
cricket in the hedge and the loud calls of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
unseen ploughman in a neighboring field;
then an old woman went by, complimenting
us on going so fast without a horse; and then
a baker&#39;s boy in white shirt and bare legs, carrying
a lamb on his shoulders. But then,
again, we met wagon after wagon, piled with
boxes and baskets, poultry and vegetables, and
sleeping men and women, and with lanterns
swinging between the wheels,&mdash;for the next
day would be Friday and market-day, and
peasants were already on their way to Florence.
There were pedlers, too, walking from
village to village, selling straw fans and gorgeous
handkerchiefs. Would not the <i>Signora</i>
have a handkerchief? one asked, showing me
the gayest of his stock. For answer I pointed
to the bags on the luggage-carrier and the
knapsack on J.&#39;s back. &quot;Of course,&quot; he said;
we already had enough to carry; would the
<i>Signora</i> forgive him for troubling her? And
with a polite bow he went on his way.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">We came to several villages and towns,&mdash;some
small, where pots and bowls, fresh from
the potter&#39;s wheel, were set out to dry; others
large, like Lastra, with heavy walls and gates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
and old archways, and steps leading up to
crooked, steep streets, so narrow the sun never
shines into them; or like Montelupo, where
for a while we sat on the bridge without the
farther gate, looking at the houses which climb
up the hillside to the cypress-encircled monastery
at the top. Women were washing in
the stream below, and under the poplars on
the bank a priest in black robes and broad-brimmed
hat walked with a young lady. But
whenever we stopped, children from far and
near collected around us. There were little
old-fashioned girls, with handkerchiefs tied
over their heads in womanly fashion, who
kept on plaiting straw, and small boys nursing
big babies, their hands and mouths full of
bread and grapes. If, however, in their youthful
curiosity they pressed upon us too closely,
polite men and women, who had also come to
look, drove them back with terrible cries of
<i>Via, ragazzi!</i> (&quot;Go away, children!&quot;) before
which they retreated with the same speed with
which they had advanced.</p>

<span class="ralign"><i>Page 20.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Just beyond Montelupo, when a tedious
up-grade brought us to a broad plateau, a cart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
suddenly came out a little way in front of us
from a side road. A man was driving, and on
the seat behind, and facing us, were two nuns,
who wore wide straw hats which flapped slowly
up and down with the motion of the cart.
When they saw us, the younger of the two
covered her face with her hands, as if she
thought us a device of the Devil. But the
other, who looked the Lady Abbess, met the
danger bravely, and sternly examined us.
This close scrutiny reassured her. When we
drew nearer she wished us good-evening, and
then her companion turned and looked. We
told them we were pilgrims bound for Rome.
At this they took courage, and the spokeswoman
begged for the babies they cared for in
Florence. We gave her a few sous. She
counted them quite greedily, and then&mdash;but
not till then&mdash;benevolently blessed us. They
were going at jog-trot pace, so that we soon
left them behind. &quot;<i>Buon viaggio</i>,&quot; the Abbess
cried; and the silent sister smiled, showing all
her pretty white teeth, for we now represented
a temptation overcome.</p>

<h2>AT EMPOLI.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;The pilgrim they laid in a large</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>upper chamber whose window opened</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>towards the sunrising; the name of</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>the chamber was Peace; where he</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>slept till break of day.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">We put up that night at Empoli. The
Albergo Maggiore was fair enough, and,
like all large Italian inns, had a clean spacious
stable in which to shelter the tricycle. The
only drawback to our comfort was the misery
at dinner of the black-eyed, blue-shirted waiter
at our refusal to eat a dish of birds we had
not ordered. He was very eager to dispose
of them. He served them with every course,
setting them on the table with a triumphant
&quot;<i>Ecco!</i>&quot; as if he had prepared a delicious
surprise. It was not until he brought our
coffee that he despaired. Then he retired
mournfully to the kitchen, where his loud talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
with the <i>padrona</i> made us fear their wrath
would fall upon us or the tricycle. But later
they gave us candles, and said good-night with
such gracious smiles that we slept the sleep
which knows neither care nor fear.</p>

<p class="indent">The next morning their temper was as unclouded
as the sky. They both watched the
loading of the tricycle with smiling interest.
He had seen velocipedes with two wheels, the
waiter said, but never one with three. And
that a <i>Signora</i> should ride, the <i>padrona</i> added,
ah! that indeed was strange! Then she
grew confidential. Only occasionally I caught
her meaning, for my knowledge of Italian was
small. She had had seven children, she said,
and all were dead but one. And I, had I
any? And where had I bought my dress?
She liked it so much; and she took it in her
hand and felt it. Should we stay long in
Italy? and sometime we would come back to
Empoli? Her son, a little fellow, was there
too. He had been hanging about the machine
when we came down to breakfast, and ever
since. He stood speechless while J. was by,
but when the latter went away for a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
minutes,&mdash;less shy with me, I suppose, because
he knew I could not understand him as well,&mdash;he
asked what might such a velocipede cost?
as much perhaps as a hundred francs? But
J. coming back he was silent as before. They
all followed us out to the street, the <i>padrona</i>
shaking hands with us both, and the boy
standing by the tricycle to the very last.</p>

<h2>THE ROAD TO FAIR AND SOFT
SIENA.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;They went till they came into a</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>certain country whose air naturally</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>tended to make one drowsy.&quot;</i></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;Let us not sleep as do others,</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>but let us watch and be sober.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It was good to be in the open country again,
warming ourselves in the hot sunshine.
The second morning of our ride was better
than the first. We knew beforehand how
beautiful the day would be, and how white and
smooth was the road that lay before us. The
white oxen behind the ploughs, and the mules
in their gay trappings and shining harness
seemed like old acquaintances. The pleasant
good-morning given us by every peasant we
met made us forget we were strangers in the
land. A little way from Empoli we crossed
the Ponte d&#39;Elsa, and then after a sharp turn
to the right we were on the road to &quot;fair and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
soft Siena.&quot; It led on through vineyards and
wide fields lying open to the sun, by sloping
hillsides and narrow winding rivers, by villas
and gardens where roses were blooming. In
places they hung over the wall into the road.
We asked a little boy to give us one,&mdash;for
the <i>Signora</i>, J. added. But the child shook
his head. How could he? The roses were
not his, he said. Once we passed a wayside
cross on which loving hands had laid a bunch
of the fresh blossoms. Sometimes we heard
from the far-away mountains the loud blasting
of rocks, and then the soft bells of a monastery;
sometimes even the cracking of the whip of
a peasant behind us, driving an unwilling
donkey. Then we would pass from the stillness
of the country into the noise and clamor
of small villages, to hear the wondering cries
of the women to which we were already growing
accustomed, the piercing yells of babies,
who well secured in basket go-carts could not
get to us quickly enough, and the sing-song
repetition of older children saying their lesson
in school, and whom we could see at their
work through the low windows.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
About noon we rode into Certaldo,&mdash;Boccaccio&#39;s
town. I know nothing that interferes
so seriously with hero-worship as hunger. I
confess that if some one had said, &quot;You can go
either to see Boccaccio&#39;s house or to lunch at
a <i>trattoria</i>, but both these things you cannot
do,&quot; our answer would have been an immediate
order for lunch. We went at once to a <i>trattoria</i>
on the piazza where Boccaccio&#39;s statue
stands. I doubt if that great man himself ever
gathered such numbers about him as we did.
Excited citizens, when the tricycle was put
away, stood on the threshold and stared at us
until the door was shut upon them. Then
they pressed their faces against the windows
and peered over piles of red and yellow pears;
and every now and then one, bolder than the
rest, stealthily thrust his head in and then
scampered off before he could be captured.
This gave a spice of novelty and excitement
to our midday meal. We ordered a very simple
lunch,&mdash;soup, bread and cheese, coffee and
vermouth. But the <i>padrona</i> had to send out
for everything. Her sister, a young girl as
fair as an Englishwoman, was her messenger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
We were scarcely seated before she came back
with coffee and a large bottle that she set
before us. This, of course, was the vermouth,
and we half filled our glasses and at once
drank a little. The two women stared with a
surprise we could not understand. The fair
girl now disappeared on a second foraging
expedition, and stayed away until we had finished
our soup. &quot;<i>Ecco</i>, vermouth!&quot; she said
on her return, putting another bottle in front
of us. Then we knew the reason of their
wonder. We had swallowed, like so much
water, the not over-strong cognac intended
only to flavor our coffee.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the <i>padrona</i> entered into conversation
with us. We were English, she
supposed. No; Americans, we told her. At
this there was great rejoicing. They had a
brother in America. He lived in a large town
called Buenos Ayres, where he kept a <i>trattoria</i>.
Like theirs it was the <i>Trattoria</i> Boccaccio.
They were glad to see any one from
the same country, whether from north or south.
Was it not all America? The <i>padrona</i> went
upstairs to bring down his picture that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
might see it. Her sister pointed to the purple
woollen jersey she wore, and said with
pride her brother had sent it to her. It too
was American. They even called in their old
mother, that she might see her son&#39;s fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p class="indent">We spent an hour wandering through the
old town, on top of the hill, in which Boccaccio
really lived. The sun was shining right down
into the streets, in which the gay kerchiefs
of the women, the bunches of straw at their
waists, and their cornstalk distaffs made bright
bits of color. Though we left the tricycle at
the <i>trattoria</i>, our coming made a stir in the
little place. Our clothes were not like unto
those of the natives, and J.&#39;s knee-breeches and
long black stockings made them wonder what
manner of priest he might be. As we stood
looking at the <i>loggia</i> and tower and arched
doorway of Boccaccio&#39;s house, the custodian,
with a heavy bunch of keys, came to take us
through it. But we declined his services. We
cared more for the old streets and walls and
palaces, which, though their greatness has
gone, have not been changed since mediæval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
times, than for an interior, however fine, whose
mediævalism dates from to-day. The old man
turned rather sulkily. J., seeing there had
been some mistake, explained we had not sent
for him. Then his face cleared. The women
had said we wanted him, else he would never
have disturbed us; and he took off his hat,
and this time went away with a friendly <i>à
rivederle</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The Palazzo Communale, at the highest
point of the town, is still covered with the
arms and insignia of other years, of the Medici
and Piccolomini, of the Orsini and Baglioni.
Its vaulted doorway is still decorated with
frescos of the Madonna, and saints and
angels. But everywhere the plaster is falling
away, and in the courtyard grass grows
between the bricks of the pavement; and instead
of pages and men-at-arms, we there saw
only a little brown-faced ragged child climbing
cat-like over the roofs, and a woman scolding
him from below. We left the town by
the frescoed gateway, through which we saw
the near hills, gray, bare, and furrowed, the
long lines of cypresses, the stretches of gray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
olives, the valley below with its vineyards,
and the far mountains, purple and shadowy,
the highest topped with many-towered San
Gimignano.</p>

<p class="indent">It is better not to be jocund with the fruitful
grape in the middle of the day when one is
tricycling. The cognac we had taken at lunch,
weak as it was, and the vermouth made us
sleepy and our feet heavy. I sympathized with
the men who lay in sound slumbers in every
cart we met. But their drowsiness forced us
into wakefulness. Of the ride from Certaldo
to Poggibonsi, I remember best the loud inarticulate
cries of J. and his calls of &quot;<i>Eccomi!</i>&quot;
as if he were lord of the land, to sleeping drivers.
The Italian cry of the roads, rising to a
high note and then suddenly falling and ending
in a low prolonged one, which is indispensable
to travellers, is not easy to learn. J.&#39;s
proficiency in it, however, made him pass for
a native when he limited himself to howling.
But often donkeys darted into ditches and
oxen plunged across the road before the peasants
behind them awoke. Like Sancho Panza
they had a talent for sleeping.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
Once, after we had climbed a short but steep
hill and had passed by several wagons in rapid
succession, we stopped under the shade to rest.
It was a pleasant place. We looked over the
broad valley, where the vines were festooned,
not as Virgil saw them, from elm to elm,
but from mulberry to mulberry, and up to
San Gimignano, beginning to take more definite
shape on its mountain-top. A peasant in
peaked hat and blue shirt, with trousers rolled
up high above his bare knees, crossed the road
and silently examined the tricycle. &quot;You have
a good horse,&quot; he then said; &quot;it eats nothing.&quot;
We asked him if they were at work in his
vineyard. No, he answered; but would we
like to look in the wine-press opposite? And
then he took us through the dark windowless
building, where on one side the grape-juice
was fermenting in large butts, and on the other
fresh grapes had been laid on sets of shelves to
dry. He picked out two of the finest bunches
and gave them to me. When I offered to pay
him he refused. The <i>Signora</i> must accept
them, he said.</p>

<p class="indent">As the road was now a dead level and lumpy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
into the bargain, we were glad when Poggibonsi
was in sight. We drew up on a bridge
where a man was standing, to ask him if he
knew of a good inn. He recommended the
Albergo dell&#39; Aquila. &quot;It is good,&quot; he went
on, &quot;and not too dear. This is not a town
where they take one by the neck,&quot; and he
clutched his own throat. So to the Albergo
dell&#39;Aquila we went. We had only to ride
through the wide avenue of shady trees, past
a row of houses, out of one of which a brown-robed
monk came, to rush back at sight of
us, past a washing-place surrounded by busy
chattering women, and we were at the door
of the inn.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;Then she asked him whence he</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>was come and whither he was going;</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>and he told her. She asked</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>him also how he got into the way;</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>and he told her. And last she asked</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>his name.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The Albergo dell&#39; Aquila was even more
comfortable than the Maggiore in Empoli.
We dined in a room from whose walls
King Humbert and his Queen smiled upon
us, while opposite were two sensational and
suggestive brigands in lonely mountain passes.
The <i>padrona</i> came up with the salad, and she
and the waiter in a cheerful duet catechised us
after the friendly Italian fashion, and then told
us about the visit to their house of the American
consul from Florence; of the hard times
the cholera had brought with it for all Italy; of
the bad roads to San Gimignano and the steep
ones to Siena, along which peasants never travelled
without bearing in mind the old saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
<i>All&#39; ingiù tutti i santi ajutano; ma all&#39; insú
ci vuol Gesù</i>,&mdash;&quot;Going down hill, call upon
the saints; but going up, one needs Jesus.&quot;
Before long J. joined in the talk, and the duet
became a trio. Never had I been so impressed
with his fluent Italian. Even the <i>padrona</i> was
not readier with her words than he with his.
When I spoke to him about it afterwards, he
said he supposed it was wonderful; he had not
understood half of it himself.</p>

<p class="indent">After dinner and in the twilight we walked
through the lively crowded streets and into the
church, where service was just over. A priest
in white surplice left the altar, and another
began to put the lights out when we entered.
But in the unlit nave many of the faithful still
knelt in prayer. The town grew quieter as
night came on. But just as we were going to
sleep some men went along the street below
our window singing. One in a loud clear
tenor sang the tune, the others the accompaniment
like a part song, and the effect was that
of a great guitar. Their song was a fitting
good-night to a day to whose beauty there had
been not a cloud.</p>

<span class="i4"><i>country, beautified with</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>woods, vineyards, fruits of all sorts,</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>flowers also with springs and fountains,</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>very delectable to behold.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Though we left Poggibonsi in the beginning
of the morning, a large crowd waited
for us at the door of the inn. The <i>padrona</i>
said farewell with many good wishes; men and
women we had never seen before called out
pleasantly <i>à rivederle</i>, two <i>carabinieri</i> watched
us from the other side of the piazza, the railroad
officials at the station cried &quot;<i>Partenza! Partenza!</i>&quot;
and then we were off and out of the
town. It would be <i>su</i>, <i>su</i>, <i>su</i>, all the way they
told us at the inn, but for several miles we
went fast enough, so that I felt sure the peasants
we passed were still only calling on the
saints. The ascent at first was very gradual,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
while the road was excellent. There were
down as well as up grades, and for every steep
climb we had a short coast. Now we came
out on villas which but a little before had been
above us, and now we reached the very summit
of hills from which we looked forth upon
mountain rising beyond mountain,&mdash;some
treeless and ashen gray, others thickly wooded
and glowing with golden greens and russets,
and still others white and mist-like, and seeming
to melt into the soft white clouds resting
on their highest peaks. All along, the hedges
were covered with clusters of red rose-berries
and the orange berries of the pyracanthus.
The grass by the roadside was gay with brilliant
crimson pinks, yellow snapdragons and
dandelions, and violet daisies. Once we came
to a vineyard where the ripe fruit still hung
in purple clusters from the vines, and where
men and women, some on foot and others on
ladders, were gathering and filling with them
large buckets and baskets. At the far end of
the field white oxen, their great heads decorated
with red ribbons, stood in waiting. Boys
with buckets slung on long poles were coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
and going between the vines. In all the other
vineyards we had passed the vintage was over,
so we waited to watch the peasants as, laughing
and singing, they worked away. But when
they saw us, they too stopped and looked, and
one man came down from his ladder and to
the hedge to offer us a bunch of grapes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The only town through which we rode was
Staggia, where workmen were busy restoring
the old tower and making it a greater ruin
than it had ever been before. One town gate
has gone, but from the battlements of the
other grass and weeds still wave with the
wind, while houses have been built into the
broken walls. It is a degenerate little town,
and its degeneracy, paradoxical as it may
sound, is the result of its activity. For its inhabitants
have not rested content like those
of Lastra with the mediævalism that surrounds
them. They have striven to make what is old
new by painting their church and many of
their houses in that scene-painting style which
to-day seems to represent the art of the people
in Italy. Often during our journey we saw
specimens of this vile fashion,&mdash;houses with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
sham windows and shutters, churches with
make-believe curtains and cords,&mdash;but nowhere
was it so prominent as in Staggia.</p>

<p class="indent">Beyond Monteriggione, whose towers alone
showed above its high walls, the road began
to wind upward on the mountain-side. It was
such a long, steady pull that although the surface
was perfect we gave up riding and walked.
Our machine was heavily loaded, and not too
easy to work over prolonged up-grades. Besides,
we were not time nor record makers, nor
perambulating advertisements, and we had the
day before us. We were now closed in with
woods. On either side were chestnuts and
dwarf-oaks and bushes, their leaves all &quot;yellow
and black and pale and hectic red.&quot; And occasional
openings showed near mountain-tops
covered with downy gray grass and a low
growth like heather, and here and there were
groups of dark pines. For an hour at least
we were alone with the sounds and silence
of the mountains. The wandering wind whispered
in the wood and black swine rooted in
the fallen leaves, but of human life there was
no sign. Then there came from afar a regular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
tap-tap, low at first, but growing louder and
louder, until, as we drew closer to it, we knew
it to be the steady hammering of stone-breakers.
There were two men at work in
this lonely pass, and as we stood talking to
them two more came from under the chestnuts.
These had guns on their shoulders, and wore
high boots and the high-crowned conventional
brigand hats. Ever since we left Florence we
had seen at intervals in the fields and woods a
notice with the words, &quot;<i>È vietata la bandita</i>,&quot;
which we interpreted as a warning against the
bandits or convicts for whom our Florentine
friends had prepared us. And now we seemed
to have come face to face with two of these brigands.
But it turned out that there was little
of the bandit about them save their appearance.
Their guns were for birds, and later on we
learned that the alarming signs were merely to
forbid the trespassing of these very gentlemen.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Slight Obstruction.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">A mile or two farther on, the road began to
go down again. We were both glad to be on
the machine after our walk. We could see to
the bottom of the hill, and there was no one in
sight. J. let go the brake. None but cyclers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
know the delight of a five-minutes coast after
hours of up-hill toiling. They, however, will
sympathize with our pleasure in the mountains
near Siena. But when it was at its fullest, and
the machine was going at the rate of about
twenty miles an hour, and neither brake nor
back-pedalling could bring it to a sudden halt,
a man (or the foul fiend himself) drove a flock
of sheep out from the woods a few feet in front
of us. When we reached them only the first
had crossed the road; of course, all the rest
had to follow. They tried to go on right
through the wheels, but only succeeded in getting
under them, setting the machine to pitching
like a ship in a heavy sea. But I held on
fast; J. stood on the pedals and screwed the
brake down; the little wheel scattered the sheep
like the cow-catcher of an engine, and we
brought up in the gutter. Before we stopped,
J. began a moral lecture to the shepherd, and
was showing him how, if the machine had
gone over, the consequences would have been
worse for us than for his flock. The lecture
ended rather <i>im</i>morally with <i>accidente voi</i>, and
<i>imbecile</i>, the deadliest of all Italian maledictions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
punishable in places by imprisonment.
The shepherd looked as if he was ready to
curse us in return, but before he had time we
were out of hearing, though we first made sure
that no sheep were injured. We were none
the worse for the accident, and the tricycle was
unhurt, save for a deep dent in the dress guard.</p>

<p class="indent">The rest of our way was divided between
walking and riding. The woods with their
solitude and wildness, but not the good road,
came to an end. Once beyond them, we
wheeled out by fields where men and women
were at work, their oxen whiter than any we
had yet seen, by contrast with the rich red
of the upturned earth. In olive-gardens peasants
were eating their midday meal; men with
white aprons, women with enormous Sienese
hats, and dogs and oxen were all resting sociably
together. By the roadside others were
making rope, the men twisting and forever
walking backwards, a small boy always turning
at the wheel. Scattered on the hill-tops
and by the road were large red-brick farm-houses,
instead of the white ones we had seen
near Florence.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">At one, where there was a well on the other
side of the wall, we asked for a glass of water.
A man brought it to the gate, where he was
joined by three or four others. They stared
inquiringly at the tricycle, at the bags, and
at us, while J. squeezed lemon-juice into the
water. Then one opened his mouth very wide
and pointed to his teeth: &quot;The little sir,&quot;
he asked, &quot;is he a dentist?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was noon when we first saw Siena, and
we were then at the very walls. In the old
days it was always said, &quot;More than her
gates, Siena opens her heart to you!&quot; But
the heart of him who sat in office by the
city gate was shut against us. When we
rode past him he bade us descend. To our
&quot;<i>Perchè?</i>&quot; he said it was the law. Oh the
vanity of these Sienese! Through the streets
of Florence and over the crowded Ponte
Vecchio we had ridden undisturbed; but in
this mountain town, which boasts of but two
hacks, and where donkeys and oxen are the
only beasts to be frightened, we were forced
to get down. The dignity of the law-makers
of the city must be respected.  So we two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
weary pilgrims had to walk along the narrow
streets, between the tall palaces, while tanners
in red caps, and women in flowered, white-ribboned
<i>festa</i> hats, and priests and soldiers
stared, and one man, with a long push-cart,
kept close to us like an evil genius in a dream.
He was now on one side, and now on the
other, examining the wheels, asking endless
questions, and always getting in the way. At
all the street corners he hurried on before, and
with loud shouts called the people to come and
see. Then he was at our heels again, shrieking
his loud, shrill trade-cry into our very ears.
J. as a rule is not ill-tempered; but there is
a limit to all things. The stupid sheep, the
watchful guard, and now this plague of a flower-pedler
brought his patience to an end, and on
our way through the town he said much in
good plain English which it was well the citizens
could not understand.</p>

<p class="indent">Even pilgrims of old on their way to
Rome sometimes tarried in castle or
village. We could not pass through Siena,
discourteous though her first welcome had
been, as we had through smaller and less fair
towns. So for a day or two we put away
our tricycle and the &quot;cockle-shells and sandal
shoon&quot; of our pilgrimage. We went to a
<i>pension</i>, one at which J. had stayed before,
and which he liked. I admit it was better
in many ways than the inns in which hitherto
we had slept and eaten. There was carpet
on the floor of our room, and in it easy-chairs
and a lounge. There were elaborate breakfasts
at one, and still more elaborate dinners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
at six, and there was always a great plenty,&mdash;as
the Englishwoman who sat next me, and
who I fear had not always fared so well, said
when she urged me to eat and drink more
of the fruit and wine set before me. &quot;You
can have all you want in this house,&quot; she finished
with a sigh, as if her crown of sorrow
was in remembering unhappier things. But
we both thought regretfully of the dining-rooms
with the bad prints on the walls, and
the more modest dinners of our own ordering.
I think too we had found more pleasure in
the half-understood talk of <i>padroni</i> and waiters
than we did now in the elegant and learned
conversation of our fellow-boarders, for they
were all, it seemed, persons of learning and
refinement. There was the retired English
major-general who sat opposite and who had
written a book, as he very soon let us know.
He recognized us as Americans before we
opened our mouths to speak, which fact he
also let us know by his reminiscences, addressed
not to us but to our neighbors. He
had travelled in Spain with Mr. Fillmore, the
ex-President, &quot;the most courteous of gentlemen;&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
he said he well knew Mr. Marion
Crawford, the talented novelist, and his uncle,
&quot;dear old Sam Ward;&quot; he had counted among
his best friends <i>Bay</i>ard Taylor, &quot;as you remember
I have said in my book.&quot; This same
book which made the major so communicative
appeared to have crushed the spirit out of his
wife; she sat silent during dinner, fortifying
herself at intervals with weak whiskey and
water.</p>

<p class="indent">Then there was the elderly English lady
travelling abroad with her daughter &quot;who has
just taken up architecture;&quot; she informed us,
&quot;she has always painted heads till now, but
she is fascinated by her architectural work.
Then I, you know, am <i>so</i> fond of water-colors.&quot;
And there was the Swedish lady, who could
talk all languages, speaking to us in something
supposed to be English, and who was as eager
in her pursuit of food for the body as for the
mind. I count the way in which she greedily
swallowed the <i>vino santo</i> in her glass, when
our host passed round the table the second
time with his precious bottle, one of the wonders
of our visit to Siena.  It was pathetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
too to see her disappointment when he turned
away, just before he reached her, his bottle
empty. And there were still others who knew
much about pictures and palaces, statues and
studios, and no doubt we might greatly have
profited thereby.</p>

<p class="indent">But we liked it better upstairs, where we
were alone and there was less culture. Our
window overlooked a high terrace in which
marigolds and many-colored chrysanthemums
were blooming, the gardens of the Piccolomini
Palace full of broad-leaved fig-trees and
pale olives, and the wide waste of mountain
and moorland stretching from the red city
walls to the high, snow-capped Apennines on
the horizon. All the morning the sun shone
in our windows, and every hour and even
oftener we heard the church bells, and the
loud, clear bugle-calls from the barracks, once
a monastery, whose mass of red and gray walls
rose from the near olives. They say it snows
in Siena in the winter-time, and that it is cold
and bleak and dreary; but I shall always think
of it as a place of flowers and sunshine and
sweet sounds.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
But best of all were the hours when we wandered
through the town, up and down dark
alley-ways and flights of steps, under brick
arches, along precipitate narrow streets where
we had to press close to the houses, or retreat
into an open door, to let the wide-horned oxen
pass by with their load; now coming out at the
very foot of La Mangia, on the broad, sunny
piazza; now by the tanneries where little
streams of brown water trickled down towards
the washing-place at the foot of the hill, and
where the walls were hung with dripping brown
skins, probably just as they were when the little
Catherine&mdash;her visions already beginning&mdash;and
Stefano walked by them and towards
home in the fading evening light, from a visit
to the older and married sister Bonaventura.
One hour we were with the past in the
shadowy aisles of the Duomo, where Moses
and Trismegistus, Solomon and Socrates,
Sibyls and Angels looked up at us from the
pavement, and rows of popes kept watch from
above the tall black and white pillars, while in
the choir beyond priests chanted their solemn
psalms. Next we were with the present in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
gay Lizza, under the acacias and yellow chestnuts,
by flower-beds full of roses and scarlet
sage, and walls now covered with brilliant
Virginia creepers; and out on the fort above
to see a golden sky, and the sun disappearing
behind banks of purple, golden-edged, and red
clouds, and pale, misty hills, and to look back
across the hollow to the red town climbing up
from low olive-gardens towards the Duomo on
its hill-top, and tall La Mangia towering aloft
from its own little hollow beyond. From every
side came the voices of many people,&mdash;of soldiers
in the barracks, of women and children
under the trees, of ball-players in the old court
below, and of applauding lookers-on lounging
on the marble benches.</p>

<span class="ralign"><i>Page 50.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The tall unfinished arch of the Duomo that
rises above houses and churches, and indeed
above everything but the lofty La Mangia and
the Campanile, tells the story of greatness and
power and wealth suddenly checked. But the
deadly plague, which carried off so many citizens
that not even enough were left to make
their city beautiful as they meant it should be,
could not take away the great beauty it already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
had, nor kill the joyousness of its people.
There are no Spendthrift Clubs in Siena now,
nor any gay Lanos like him Dante met in the
<i>Inferno</i>. But there are still laughter and song
loving Sienese who in their own simple fashion
go through life gathering rosebuds while
they may. It seemed to me a very pretty
fashion when I saw them holiday-making on
Sunday afternoon, peasants, priests, officers,
townspeople, all out in their Sunday best,
and when on the Via Cavour, near the <i>Loggia</i>,
we met two wandering minstrels singing love-songs
through the town. One played on a
mandolin which hung from his neck by a wide
red ribbon, and as he played he sang. His
voice was loud and strong and very sweet, and
like another Orpheus he drew after him all
who heard his music. His companion sold
copies of the song, printed on pink paper, gay
as the words. He went bowing and smiling
in and out of the crowd,&mdash;from the women
whose broad hats waved as they kept time to
the singing, to the men who had stuck feathers
in their soft felts worn jauntily on one side;
from demure little girls holding their nurses&#39;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
hands, to swaggering soldiers. Then when the
first singer rested he, in his turn, sang a verse.
There was with them a small boy who every
now and then broke in in a high treble, so that
there was no pause in the singing.</p>

<p class="indent">Wherever we went that afternoon, whether
by the Duomo or out by the Porta Romana,
on the Lizza or near San Domenico, we saw
large written posters, announcing that at six
in the evening there would be, at No. 17
Via Ricasoli, a great marionette performance
of the <i>Ponte dei Sospiri</i>. Apparently this was
to be the event of the day, and to it we determined
to go. When a little before the appointed
hour we came to the Via Ricasoli, we
half expected to see a theatre ablaze with light.
What we did find after much difficulty was a
low doorway on the ground floor of a many-storied
palace, and before it a woman by a
table, lighting a very small lamp, to the evident
satisfaction of half a dozen youngsters. Over
the open doorway was a chintz curtain; behind
it, darkness. This was not encouraging.
But presently a woman with a child came to
buy tickets. One of the groups of youthful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
admirers was then sent up and a second down
the street, and after they had come back with
mysterious bundles another lamp was produced,
lit, and carried inside, and the first two of the
audience followed. It was now five minutes of
six, so we also bought our tickets, three <i>soldi</i>,
or cents, for each, and the curtain was drawn
for us.</p>

<p class="indent">A low crypt-like room with vaulted ceiling;
at one end two screens covered with white
sheets; between them a stage somewhat larger
than that of a street Punch, with a curtain
representing a characteristic Sienese brick wall
enclosing a fountain; several rows of rough
wooden benches, and one of chairs,&mdash;this was
what we saw by the dim light of one lamp.
We sat on the last bench. The audience
probably would be more entertaining than the
play. But the humble shall be exalted. The
woman on the front row bade us come up
higher. The small boy who acted as usher
told us we might have two of the chairs for
two <i>soldi</i> more. The ticket-seller even came
in, and in soft pleading tones said that we
might have any places we wanted; why then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
should we choose the worst? But we refused
the exaltation.</p>

<p class="indent">The audience now began to arrive in good
earnest. Five ragged boys of the <i>gamin</i> species,
one of a neater order with his little sister
by the hand, two soldiers, a lady with a blue
feather in her bonnet, and her child and nurse,
two young girls,&mdash;and the benches were almost
filled. Our friend the ticket-seller became
very active as business grew brisk. She
was always running in and out, now giving
this one a seat, now rearranging the reserved
chairs, and now keeping the younger members
of the audience in order. <i>Ragazzini</i>, she called
the unruly boys who stood up on the benches
and whistled and sang, so that I wondered
what diminutive she gave the swells on the
front row. This was amusing enough, but our
dinner-hour was half-past six. J. looked at
his watch; it was a quarter past. The ever-watchful
keeper of the show saw him. &quot;Ah,
the <i>Signore</i> must not be impatient. <i>Ecco!</i>
the music was about to begin.&quot; Begin it did
indeed, to be continued with a persistency
which made us fear it would never end. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
musicians were two. A young man in velveteen
coat and long yellow necktie played
the clarionet, and another the cornet. They
knew only one tune,&mdash;a waltz I think it was
meant to be,&mdash;but that they gave without stint,
playing it over and over again, even while
the ticket-seller made them move from their
chairs to a long, high box by the wall; and
when a third arrived with a trombone they
let him join in when and as it best pleased
him. When we had heard at least the twenty-fifth
repetition of the waltz, had looked at the
scuffling of the <i>ragazzini</i> until even that pleasure
palled, had seen the soldiers smoke <i>sigaro
Cavour</i> after <i>sigaro Cavour</i> so that the air
grew heavy, and had watched the gradual
growth of the audience until every place was
filled, our patience was exhausted. Behold!
we said to the woman with the gentle voice,
it was now seven. The play was announced
for six. Was this right? In a house not far
off every one was eating, and two covers were
laid for us. But here we were in this dark
room in our hunger, waiting for marionettes
whose wires for aught we knew were broken.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
She became penitent. The <i>signorini</i> must
forgive her. The wires were not broken, but
he who pulled them had not arrived. There
was yet time. Would we not go and dine
and then come back? She would admit us
on our return.</p>

<p class="indent">And so we went and had our dinner, well
seasoned with polite conversation. The ticket-agent
was true to her word. When we reappeared
at her door, the curtain was pulled
at once. In the mean time the musicians had
been suppressed, not only out of hearing but
out of sight. The room was so crowded that
many who had arrived during our absence
were standing. Indeed, there must have been
by this time fully five francs in the house. All
were watching with entranced eyes the movements
of four or five puppets. The scene
represented an interior, which I suppose, was
that of the prison to one side of the Bridge
of Sighs. That it was intended for a cell also
seemed evident, because the one portable piece
of furniture on the stage was a low, flat couch
of a shape which as every one who has been
to the theatre, but never to prison, knows is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
peculiar to the latter. It was impossible to
lose sight of it, as the <i>dramatis personæ</i> made
their exits and entrances over it. It was rather
funny to see the villain of the piece after an
outbreak of passion, or an elegant long-haired
page in crimson clad, after a gentlemanly
speech, suddenly vault over it. We could not
discover what the play was about. Besides the
two above-mentioned characters there was a
puppet with a large red face and green coat
and trousers who gave moral tone to the dialogue,
and another with heavy black beard
and turban-like head-dress, and much velvet
and lace whom we took to be a person of
rank. As they came in and out by turn, it
was impossible to decide which was the prisoner.
With the exception of the jumps over
the couch, there was little action in the performance.
Its only two noticeable features
were&mdash;first, the fact that villain, page, moralist,
and magnate spoke in exactly the same voice
and with the same expression; and, secondly,
that they had an irrepressible tendency to
stand in the air rather than on the floor, as
if they had borrowed Mr. Stockton&#39;s negative-gravity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
machine. The applause and laughter
and rapt attention of the audience proved the
play to be much to their liking. But for us
inappreciative foreigners a little of it went a
great way. As nothing but talk came of all
the villany and moralizing and grandeur and
prettiness,&mdash;which may have been a clever
bit of realism of which the English drama is
not yet capable,&mdash;and as there was no apparent
reason why the dialogue should ever
come to an end, we went away after the next
act. The ticket-seller was surprised at our
sudden change from eagerness to indifference,
but not offended. She thanked us for our
patronage and wished us a <i>felice notte</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">With the darkness the gayety of the town
had increased. In the large theatre a play was
being performed by a company of amateurs.
Having had tickets given us, we looked in for
a few minutes, but found it as wordy as that of
the puppets. In a neighboring piazza the proprietor
of a large van, like those to be seen at
country fairs at home, was exhibiting a man,
arrayed in a suit of rubber, with a large brass
helmet-like arrangement on his head, who, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
seemed, could live at the bottom of the sea,
along with Neptune and the Naiads, as comfortably
as on dry shore. <i>Ecco!</i> There was
the tank within, where this marvel could be
seen,&mdash;a human being living under the water
and none the worse for it! Admission was
four <i>soldi</i>, but <i>per militari e ragazzi</i> (&quot;for the
military and children&quot;) it was but two! So
it seems that the soldiers who abroad are to
strike terror into the enemy, at home are
ranked with the young of the land, since
like them their name is legion! There were
about a dozen in the crowd, and, all unconscious
of the sarcasm, they hurried up the steps
and into the show, while an old man ground
out of a hand-organ the appropriate tune of
&quot;<i>O, que j&#39;aime les militaires!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But dramas and shows were not the only
Sunday-evening amusements. The <i>caffès</i> were
crowded. Judging from the glimpses we had
into little black, cavern-like wine-shops, another
Saint Bernardino is needed to set
makers of gaming-tools in Siena to the manufacture
of holier articles. And more than once,
as we walked homewards in the starlight, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
heard the voices of the three minstrels singing
of human passion in the streets where Catherine
so often preached the rapture of divine
love. If swans were now seen in visions by
fond Sienese matrons, they would wing their
way earthward and not heavenward, as in the
days when Blessed Bernardo&#39;s mother dreamed
dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">We left Siena the morning after the marionette
exhibition. The major, when he
heard at breakfast that we were going, asked
us point blank several questions about Boston
publishers, his book probably being still uppermost
in his thoughts. Later he sent his card
to our room to know at what hour we started;
he wished to see us off. The young lady of
architectural proclivities shook hands and bade
us good-by, saying she had often ridden a
sociable with her cousin in England.</p>

<p class="indent">After all, there was not much for the major
to see. We could not ride through the streets,
and so could not mount the machine for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
benefit. But he was interested in watching
us strap the bags to the luggage-carrier, and
pleased because of this opportunity to entertain
us with more American reminiscences. I am
afraid his amusement in Siena was small. In
return for the little we gave him he asked us
to come and see him in Rome, where he would
spend the winter, and added that if we expected
to pass through Cortona he would like
to write a card of introduction for us to a
friend of his there, an Italian who had married
an English lady. Cortona was a rough place,
and we might be glad to have it. He had forgotten
his friend&#39;s name, but he would run upstairs
and his wife could tell him. In a minute
he returned with the written card. We have
had many letters of introduction, but never
one as singular as the major-general&#39;s. As
he knew our names even less well than that of
his Cortona friends, he introduced us as &quot;an
American lady and gentleman riding a <i>bicycle</i>!&quot;
Only fancy! as the English say. Our
parting with him was friendly. Then he stood
with Luigi and Zara until we disappeared
around the corner of the street.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
What a ride we had from Siena to Buonconvento!
This time the road was all <i>giù</i>, <i>giù</i>,
<i>giù</i>. It was one long coast almost all the way,
and we made the most of it. We flew by milestone
after milestone. Once we timed ourselves:
we made a mile in four minutes. The
country through which we rode was sad and
desolate. On either side were low rolling hills,
bare as the English moors, and of every shade
of gray and brown and purple. Here rose a
hill steeper than the others, with a black cross
on its summit; and here, one crowned with a
group of four grim cypresses. Down the hillsides
were deep ruts and gullies, with only an
occasional patch of green, where women were
watching sheep and swine. Once we came
to where three or four houses were gathered
around a small church, but they were as desolate
as the land. We heard voices in the distance,
but there was no one in sight. When
on a short stretch of level road we stopped to
look at this strange gray land, the grayer because
dark clouds covered the sky, we saw that
above the barrenness the sun shone on Siena,
and that all her houses, overtowered by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
graceful La Mangia and the tall Duomo Campanile,
glistened in the bright light.</p>

<p class="indent">About five miles from the city the desolation
was somewhat relieved, for there were hedges
by the roadside, and beyond sloping olive-gardens
and vineyards. Poplars grew by little
streams and sometimes we rode under oaks.
On the top of every gray hill, giving it color,
was a farm-house, rows of brilliant pumpkins
laid on its red walls, ears of yellow corn hung
in its <i>loggia</i>, and gigantic haystacks standing
close by. There were monasteries too, great
square brick buildings with tall towers, and
below spire-like cypresses. But between the
farms and fertile fields were deep ravines and
dry beds of streams. The road was lonely.
Now and then flocks of birds flew down in
front of the tricycle, or large white geese came
out from under the hedge and hissed at us.
For a few minutes a man driving a donkey-cart
made the way not a little lively. He did
not see us until we wheeled by him. Then
he jumped as if he had been shot. &quot;<i>Dio!</i>&quot;
he exclaimed, &quot;but you frightened me!&quot; He
laughed, however, and whipping up his donkey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
rattled after us as if eager for a race, talking
and shouting all the while until we were out of
hearing. One or two peasants passed in straw
chariot-shaped wagons, and once from a farm-house
a woman in red blouse and yellow apron,
with a basket on her head and a dog at her
heels, came towards us. It was in this same
farm-house we met a Didymus. We stopped,
as we had a way of doing when anything
pleased us, and he came out to have a better
look at the <i>tramway</i>. And how far did we
expect to go to-day? he asked. To Monte
Oliveto, we told him, for, like pious pilgrims,
we thought to make a day&#39;s retreat with the
monks there. &quot;To Monte Oliveto! and in
a day, and on that machine!&quot; and he laughed
us to scorn. &quot;In a week, the <i>Signore</i> had better
say.&quot; Later a stone-breaker&#39;s belief in us
made some amends for the farmer&#39;s contempt.
We were riding then. &quot;<i>Addio!</i>&quot; he cried,
even before we reached him.</p>

<p class="indent">I shall always remember a little village
through which we rode that morning, because
it was there we saw the first large stone-pine
growing by the roadside, which showed we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
were getting farther south, and because of the
friendliness of a peasant. It was a poor place.
The people were ragged and squalid and
sickly, as if the gloom of the hills had fallen
upon them. We asked at a shop for a lemon,
but there was not one to be had. &quot;Wait,&quot;
cried a woman standing close by, and she disappeared.
She returned almost immediately
with a lemon on whose stem there were still
fresh green leaves. &quot;<i>Ecco!</i>&quot; she said, &quot;it is
from my garden.&quot; &quot;How much?&quot; asked J.,
as she handed it to him. &quot;Oh, nothing, sir,&quot;
and she put her hands behind her back. We
made her take a few coppers, for the children
we told her. As far as it lay in her power I
think she was as courteous as those men in a
certain Italian town who, in days long past,
fought together for the stranger who came
within their gates, so eager were they all, not
to cheat him, as is the way with modern landlords,
but to lodge him at their own expense, so
that there were no inns in that town.</p>

<p class="indent">Before we reached Buonconvento the sun
came out and the clouds rolled away. It had
rained here earlier in the morning. The roads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
were sticky and the machine ran heavily, and
trees and hedges were wet with sparkling raindrops.
There is an imposing entrance to the
little town, a pointed bridge over a narrow
stream, with a Madonna and Child in marble
relief at the highest point, an avenue of tall
poplars with marble benches set between, and
then the heavy brick walls blackened with age,
and the gateway, its high Gothic arch decorated
with the old Sienese wolf and a more
recent crop of weeds.</p>

<p class="indent">We rode from one end to the other,&mdash;a
two minutes&#39; ride,&mdash;without finding a <i>trattoria</i>.
At length we appealed to the crowd. Where
was the <i>trattoria</i>? No one understood; and
yet that very morning J. had been asked if
he were not a Florentine! Perhaps <i>monsieur</i>
speaks French? and a little Frenchman in
seedy clothes jauntily worn, and with an indescribable
swagger, came forward, hat in
hand. The effect of his coming was magical.
For unknown reasons, when it was found that
J. could speak French after a fashion, his
Italian was all-sufficient. The inn was here;
we were directly in front of it, and the <i>padrone</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
who had been at our elbows all the time, led
the way into it. The Frenchman gallantly
saw us through the crowd to the room where
we were to dine. It was the best <i>trattoria</i> in
the place, but poor enough, he said. Such
bread and cheese! horrible! and he shrugged
his shoulders and raised his hands to heaven
in testimony thereof. He did not live in
Buonconvento, not he. He came from Paris.
Then he complimented J. on his Italian, to
make up in some measure for the failure of
the people to appreciate it, and with a bow
that might have won him favor at court, and a
&quot;I salute you, <i>monsieur</i> and <i>madame</i>,&quot; he
politely left us before our dinner was served.
He was a strolling actor, the <i>padrone</i> said;
he and his troupe would give a performance in
the evening.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 538px;">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chiusure.</span>
<span class="ralign"><i>Page 68.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The fact that we were going to Monte
Oliveto annoyed the <i>padrone</i>. The monastery
is a too successful rival to his inn. Few
travellers, except those who are on their way
to Monte Oliveto, pass through his town, and
few who can help it stay there over night.
His list of the evils we should have to endure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
was the sauce with which he served our beefsteak
and potatoes. We must leave the post
road for one that was stony and steep. Our
velocipede could not be worked over it. It
would take hours to reach the monastery, and
we had better not be out after dark, for there
were dangers untold by the way. But when
he had said the worst he became cheerful, and
even seemed pleased when we admired his
kitchen, where brass and copper pots and pans
hung on the walls, and where in one corner
was a large fireplace with comfortable seats
above and a pigeon-house underneath. But
when we complimented him on the walls of
his town, Bah! he exclaimed, of what use were
they? They were half destroyed. They would
be no defence in war-times.</p>

<p class="indent">He was right. The walls, strong by the
gate, have in parts entirely disappeared, and
in others, houses and stables have been made
of them. It is on the open space by these
houses that the men have their playground.
They were all there when we arrived, and still
there when we left. Young men, others old
enough to be their fathers, and boys were, each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
in turn, holding up balls to their noses, and
then, with a long slide and backward twist of
the arm, rolling them along the ground, which
is the way Italians play bowls.</p>

<p class="indent">Before the afternoon was over we cursed in
our hearts the Tuscan politeness we had heretofore
praised. About a mile from Buonconvento
the road to Monte Oliveto divided. We
turned to the right. But two peasants with
ox-teams called out from below that we must
not go that way. It was all bad. But to
the left it was good, and <i>piano</i>, ascending
but gently, and we had much better take it.
In an evil moment we did. That it ill behooves
a wise man to seek counsel in every
word spoken to him, we found to our cost. In
the first place the ascent was not gentle,&mdash;we
had not then learned that an Italian calls every
hill that is not as straight up and down as the
side of a house, <i>piano</i>,&mdash;and in the second
place the road was not good, but vilely bad.
Unfortunately, for half a mile or perhaps more
it was fair enough. But when we had gone
just so far that we were unwilling to turn back
we discovered our mistake. The road we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
not taken was that built by the monks hundreds
of years ago; we had chosen the new
and not yet finished by-way. It was heavy
with dust and dirt, and full of ruts and loose
stones. Over it we could not ride or even
push the tricycle without difficulty. It was
in keeping, however, with the abomination of
desolation lying to each side. For we were
now in a veritable wilderness, a land of deserts
and of pits, where few men dwell. All around
us were naked, colorless chalk-hills, abrupt
precipices and ravines. A few chestnut-trees,
a rose-bush covered with red berries growing
from the gray earth, were the only green things
we passed for miles. It was weary and slow
work, and the sun was low on the hill-tops
before we came to the point where the two
roads met. At some distance above us we saw
a large red building surrounded by cypresses,
and we knew this must be Monte Oliveto
Maggiore. So we took heart again.</p>

<p class="indent">But our trouble was not over. The road
was better only by comparison, and it was still
impossible to ride, and hard work to push or
pull the tricycle. It was built of bricks, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
lay as if they had been carelessly shot out of a
cart and left where and how they fell. A little
farther on it divided again. A woman was
walking towards us, and J. asked her which
was the road to the convent (<i>il convento</i>).
&quot;You must go back,&quot; she said; &quot;it lies miles
below,&mdash;Buonconvento.&quot; &quot;These peasants are
fools,&quot; said J. in angry English to her very
face; but she, all unconscious, smiled upon us.
We went to the left, which fortunately was just
what we ought to have done. But it was provoking
that instead of getting nearer to the
monastery, we seemed to be going farther from
it. With one turn of the road it appeared to
be above, and with the next below us. Now it
was on one side and now on the other, until I
began to feel as if we were the answer to the
riddle I had so often been asked in my childhood,
the mysterious &quot;What is it that goes
round and round the house and never gets in?&quot;
Soon the sun set behind the hills, and the sky
grew soft and golden. We met several peasants
bearing large bundles of twigs on their
heads. There were one or two shrines, a
chapel, and a farm-house in front of which a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
priest stood talking to a woman. But on we
went without resting, J. pushing the machine
and I walking behind, womanlike shirking
my share of the work. The road grew
worse until it became nothing but a mass of
ruts and gullies washed out by the rain, and
led to a hill from which even Christian would
have turned and fled. But we struggled up,
reaching the top to see the gate of the monastery
some sixty or seventy feet below. Finally
we came to the great brick gateway which in
the dull light&mdash;for by this time the color had
faded from the sky&mdash;rose before us a heavy
black pile, beyond whose archway we saw only
shadow and mystery. As we walked under it
our voices, when we spoke, sounded unnatural
and hollow. On the other side the road wound
through a gloomy grove of cypresses, growing
so close together that they hedged us about
with impenetrable darkness. Once several
silent figures, moving noiselessly, passed by.
Had we, by mischance, wandered into a Valley
of the Shadow of Death?</p>

<p class="indent">The cypress grove, after several windings,
brought us face to face with the building at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
which we had already so often looked from the
distance. Even in the semi-darkness we could
see the outline distinctly enough to know we
were standing in front of the church, and that
the detached building a little to our left was
a barn or stable. But not a light shone in a
window, not a doorway was in sight. I recalled
my convent experience of bygone years, and
remembered that after eight o&#39;clock in the
evening no one was admitted within its walls.
Was there a rule like this at Monte Oliveto,
and was six the hour when its bolts and bars
were fastened against the stranger? As we
hesitated where to go or what to do next,
three or four workmen came from the stable.
J. spoke to them, and one offered to show him
the entrance to the monastery while I waited
by the tricycle. It was strange to stand in the
late evening and in the wilderness alone, with
men whose speech I barely understood and
whose faces I could not see. For fully five
minutes I waited thus while they talked together
in low voices. But at last I heard
one cry, <i>Ecco!</i> here was the <i>padrone</i>; and they
all took off their hats.  A dog ran up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
examined me, and then a man, who I could just
make out in the gloom, wore a cassock and the
broad-brimmed priestly hat, joined the group.
&quot;<i>Buona sera</i>,&quot; he said to me.</p>

<p class="indent">Could I speak to him in French, I asked.
Yes, he assented, what was it I wanted?
When I told him we wished to stay in the
monastery, he said he had not expected us.
We had not written.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;we thought strangers
were allowed to stay here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered; &quot;there is a <i>pension</i> in
the monastery, but it is for artists.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And my husband is an artist,&quot; I interrupted
eagerly, for from his manner I feared he would
refuse us admission. After all, what did he
know about us except that, vagrant-like, we
were wandering in the mountains at a most
unseasonable hour? Indeed, when later I
reflected on the situation, I realized that we
must have seemed suspicious characters. At
this critical moment J. returned. His guide
had led him to a small side-door beyond the
church. There he rang and rang again. The
bell was loud and clear, and roused many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
echoes within, but nothing else. The guide,
perplexed, then led him back. I told him
with whom I was speaking, and he continued
the conversation with the <i>padrone</i>. Had they
talked in Italian only, or in French, they might
have understood each other; but instead they
used a strange mixture of the two, to their
mutual bewilderment. If this kept on much
longer we should undoubtedly spend the night
in the open air. In despair I broke in in
French: &quot;But, my father, cannot we stay this
one night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; he said, fortunately dropping
all Italian. &quot;That is what I was explaining
to <i>monsieur</i>. You can stay, but of course we
have nothing prepared. We will do our best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If he had said he would do his worst, provided
we were rid of the tricycle for the night,
and were ourselves taken indoors where we
might sit down, we should have been thankful.</p>

<p class="indent">The bags were unstrapped and given into
the care of one of the men, a place was made
for the machine in the stable, and then we followed
the <i>padrone</i> or <i>Abate</i>&mdash;for this was his
real title&mdash;to the door where J. had rung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
in vain, and which he opened with his key.
Within it was so dark that we groped our way
through a hall and a small cloister. Then we
came to a flight of steps, where at the bidding
of the <i>Abate</i>, as if to reassure us that we were
not being led to secret cells or torture-chambers,
the man carrying our bags struck a solitary
match. By this feeble light we walked
up the broad stone stairs and through many
passage-ways, not a sound breaking the stillness
but our foot-falls and their loud echoes, to a
door where the <i>Abate</i> left us, and at the same
time the match burnt out. But the next minute
he reappeared with a lighted taper, and at
the end of the hall opened another door, lit a
lamp on a table within, and showed us four
rooms, which he said were at our disposal.
The beds were not made, but they would be
attended to immediately. He had now to say
Office, but at nine supper would be served.
Here was a very comfortable solution to the
mystery into which the massive gateway
seemed to lead. The Valley of the Shadow
of Death had turned out to be a Delectable
Land!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
It was still more comfortable later, when, his
Office said, the <i>Abate</i> came back and sat and
talked with us. Now he could examine us by
a better light I think he concluded we were
not dangerous characters, probably only harmless
lunatics. However that may be, after half
an hour, when the supper-bell rang and we
started off for the refectory, again by the light
of his taper, we were the best of friends. The
long corridor, thus dimly seen, seemed interminable.
We went down one stairway to find
the door locked against us, then up and down
another. Here the light went out, leaving us
in a darkness like unto that of Egypt. The
<i>Abate</i> laughed as if it were the best of jokes.
He took J.&#39;s hand and J. took mine, and
thus like three children we went laughing
down the stairway and along more passages,
and at last into a long refectory, at the farther
end of which was a lamp, while a door to one
side of that by which we entered opened, and a
second monk in white robes, holding a lighted
taper, came in, and when he saw us made a low
bow. As there were no other visitors, we were
to eat with him and his brother monk, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
<i>Abate</i> said; and then he gave me the head of
the table, asking me if I were willing to be the
Lady Abbess.</p>

<p class="indent">If we had been two prodigals he could not
have been kinder than he was now he had
given us shelter. If we had been starving like
the hero of the parable, he could not have been
more anxious to set before us a feast of plenty.
Nor would any fatted calf have been more to
our taste than the substantial supper prepared
for us. We must eat, he said; we needed it.
He had seen us coming up the hill as he
talked with a peasant by the roadside; but
<i>monsieur</i> was push-pushing the velocipede and
looking at nothing else, and <i>madame</i> was panting
and swinging her arms, staring straight in
front of her, and before he had time, we had
passed. We must drink too; the wine was
good for us. We must not mix water with it;
it was Christian, why then should it be baptized?
The white-robed brother spoke little,
but he never allowed J.&#39;s plate to remain empty.
When the meat was brought in we were joined
by Pirro, a good-sized dog with no tail to speak
of, and Lupo, an unusually large cat, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
numerous family, who all had to be fed at intervals.
But even while Pirro jumped nimbly
into the air after pieces of bread thrown to him,
and Lupo scratched, and his progeny made
mournful appeals to be remembered, and we
talked, I looked every now and then down the
long narrow table to where it was lost in deep
shadow. The cloth was laid its entire length,
as if in readiness for the banished brothers
whenever they might return. I should not
have been surprised then to see the door open
to admit a procession of white-robed monks,
all with tapers in their hands.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Abate</i> must have realized that to a
stranger there was something uncanny in his
dark, silent, deserted monastery, and his last
word as he bade us good-night was, that we
were to fear nothing, and sleep in peace.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">The days we spent at Monte Oliveto were
golden days. For we not only slept
there one, but several nights, and the <i>Abate</i>
declared we could remain as long as we might
care to. Nothing could be more melancholy
and wild than the country into which we had
come. It is the most desolate part of all that
strange desolation which lies to the southeast
of Siena. The mountain on which the monastery
is built is surrounded on every side but
one by deep, abrupt ravines. Behind it rise
higher mountains, bare and bleak and gray,
like gigantic ash-piles, and on the very highest
peak is the wretched little village of Chiusure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
The other hills around are lower, and from the
road by the convent gateway one can see
Siena, pale and blue on the horizon, and southward,
over the barren hill-tops, Monte Amiata.
But Monte Oliveto, with its gardens and orchards
and vineyards, is a green place in the
midst of the barrenness. The mountain-sides
are terraced, and olives and vines grow almost
to the bottom of the ravine. It was said in old
times that the Bishop of Arezzo was commanded
in a vision to call the monastery after
the Mount in Jerusalem. Now-a-days sceptics
say the trees on the terraces explain the name,
forgetting that in its beginning this hill was as
bare as the others. Why cannot it be believed,
for the legend&#39;s sake, that the olives were
planted afterwards because of the name?</p>

<p class="indent">The first morning, the <i>Abate</i> took us to see
the frescos representing the life of Saint Benedict,
painted on the walls of the large cloister.
I will be honest, and confess that they disappointed
us. I doubt whether the artists were
very proud of them. Luca Signorelli, before
he had finished the first side of the cloister,
gave up the work, as it is not likely he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
have done had he cared much for it. Sodoma,
when he took his place, was at first so careless
that the then abbot took him to task, but the
artist calmly told him more could not be expected
for the price that was paid him. Certainly
with neither were these frescos a labor
of love, and this one feels at once. One wonders
if this could have been the same Sodoma
who painted the Saint Sebastian in Florence,
and yet there is more charm in his pictures than
in those of Signorelli. But what we cared for
most were his portraits of himself, with heavy
hair hanging about his face, and wearing the
cloak the Milanese gentleman, turned monk,
had given him, and of his wife and child; and
the pictures of the raven and the other pets
he brought with him to the monastery, to the
wonder of the good monks. It is a pity every
one cannot look at these frescos with such
loving, reverential eyes as the <i>Abate</i>. He had
shown them probably to hundreds of visitors;
he had seen them almost every day for the
many years he had been at Monte Oliveto;
but his pleasure in them was as fresh as if it
dated but from yesterday. He told the story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
of each in turn,&mdash;of how in this one the great
Saint Benedict had set the devil to flight, and
how in that he had by a miracle recalled an
erring brother; and once he pointed to a palm-tree
in a background. Sodoma, he said, had
seen and admired a palm in the garden of the
monastery, and so, after his realistic fashion,
had painted it in just as he had his pets. That
very tree was in the garden still; he would
show it to us if we liked.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monte Oliveto.</span>
<span class="ralign"><i>Page 84.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">There never was such another garden! It
is close to the large brick house or palace by
the gateway, where in old times lay visitors
were lodged, and beyond which no woman was
ever allowed to pass. It is small, but in it the
monks only raised the rarest trees and plants.
Here grew the precious herbs out of which
in the pharmacy, whose windows overlook the
quiet green enclosure, they prepared the healing
draughts for which people came from far and
near. The pharmacy is closed now. There
is dust in the corners and on the quaint old
chairs. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling. But
brass scales are still on the heavy wooden
counter, and pestle and mortar behind it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
glass retorts of strange shapes in the corners
and above the doors. Majolica jars all marked
with the three mountains, the cross, and the
olive-branch,&mdash;the <i>stemma</i> of the monastic order,&mdash;are
ranged on the brown shelves, many
of the large ones carefully sealed, while from
the smaller come forth strange odors of myrrh
and incense and rare ointments. As in the
refectory, everything here is in order for the
monks when they return. But they will find
more change in the garden below. The rare
plants, the ebony and the hyssop, the cactuses
and the palm (which made us think less of
Sodoma&#39;s frescos than we had before), the
pomegranates and the artichokes, are all there.
But weeds grow in the paths, and by the old
gray well, and in among the herbs; roses
have run riot in the centre of the garden and
turned it into a wild tangled growth. To us
it seemed the loveliest spot in Monte Oliveto.
The hours spent in it were like a beautiful
idyl of Theocritus or Shelley. The sun shone
and the air was filled with sweet spicy scents.
To one side was the gray mountain, to the
other dense cypresses, and above a blue, cloudless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
sky. The roses were still in bloom, and
as we lingered there, the <i>Abate</i> went from
bush to bush and picked for me a large bunch
of fragrant buds. I hope if the monks ever
do come back that, while they throw open the
windows of the pharmacy and let the light
in again upon the majolica and the dark woodwork,
they will leave the gates of the garden
locked. It is fairer in its confusion than it
ever could be with weeded paths and well-clipped
bushes.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Abate</i> took us everywhere,&mdash;through
the empty guest-chambers of the palace to the
tower, now a home for pigeons, from the top
of which one has a wide view of the country,
which with its squares of olives and its gray
hills and fields marked by deep furrows, as if
by boundary lines, looks like a large map or
geological chart,&mdash;through the monastery, with
its three hundred rooms with now but three
monks to occupy them; its cloisters, for there
are two besides the large frescoed one; its
<i>loggie</i>, where geraniums and other green plants
were growing; its great refectory, beyond the
door of which fowl or flesh meat never passed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
and which is now used no longer; and its
library, at the very top of the house, where
rows of white vellum volumes are ready for the
students who so seldom come. Then he led
us to the church, where there are more altars
than monks to pray before them, and a wonderful
choir with inlaid stalls; and in and out
of little chapels, one of which contains the
grotto where blessed Bernardo Tolomei, the
founder of the order, lived for many years after
he came to the wilderness, while another was
the first church used by the brotherhood, and
the Virgin with angels playing to her on harps
and mandolins, above the altar, was painted
long before Signorelli and Sodoma began their
work. Then there was the lemon-grove to be
seen, where the <i>Abate</i> filled our pockets with
the ripe fruit which we were to keep, he said,
in case we might be thirsty on the road some
day when there was no wine or water near by
to drink. And after that there was still to be
visited the wine-press, with its deep shadows
and dark corners and long subterranean passage
to the room below, where men were filling
small casks from large butts, and then carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
them off on their shoulders to be weighed
and stored above. We had to taste the wine,
and I think it, together with the sunshine and
the flowers, must have gone to our heads that
morning and stayed there so long as we were at
Monte Oliveto, for everything about us seemed
to belong less to the actual world than to a
dreamland full of wonder and beauty, and
sometimes of pathos.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the same in the afternoon, when the
<i>Abate</i> had gone about his work,&mdash;for he is a
busy man, like the centurion with many under
him,&mdash;and J. and I wandered alone over the
gray hills up to Chiusure. Life with its hardships
must be real enough to the people of
this little village, in which seeds of pestilence
sown hundreds of years ago still bear the bitter
fruit of wretchedness. It seems as if the brick
walls which could not keep out the plague
have ever since successfully barred the way to
all prosperity, for generation after generation
is born within them but to live and die in
poverty. We saw melancholy figures there,&mdash;old
hags of women, with thin white hair and
bent almost double under heavy bundles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
wood, toiling up steep stony streets with bare
feet, and others crouching in the gloom opposite
open doorways. Even the little priest,
who, in his knee-breeches and long frock-coat
and braided smoking-cap with tassels dangling
in his eyes, was humorous enough to look at,
was pathetic in his way. For after he had
shown us his church with its decorations, poor
as the people who worship in it, and offered us
a glass of wine in his own parlor, he spread on
the table before us some broken pieces of glass
easily put together, on which a picture was
painted. Was it of value? he asked, so eagerly
that he told without further words the story of
wants but ill supplied. He was willing to sell
it, but he did not know what it was worth.
Could we tell him? No, we could not, we said,
for we really knew nothing about it, though we
feared the hopes he had set upon it would
never be realized. And then sadly he gathered
together the pieces and put them away again
in their newspaper wrapping.</p>

<p class="indent">It was more cheerful outside the gateway.
There, in the late afternoon, the gray olives by
the way were more clearly defined against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
sky, and the gray ravines below more indistinct.
Beyond, the hills, now all purple and soft, rolled
away to the horizon and to the brilliant red
sky above. One or two lights were lit in distant
farm-houses, and once we heard a far-off
bell. Before us the white road led by one
green hill on whose top was a circle of cypresses,
and in its centre a black cross, as in
so many old pictures.</p>

<p class="indent">But the strangest part of this dream-life was
the friendship that sprung up between us and
the monks. I should not have been more surprised
if Saint Benedict and Blessed Bernardo
had come back to earth to make friends with
us. It was not only that the <i>Abate</i> acted as
our guide through the monastery,&mdash;this he
does for every visitor who comes, since the
Government took possession of it and turned
it into a public art-gallery and <i>pension</i> for
artists,&mdash;but he came to our room early in the
morning to drink his coffee with us, and in the
evening, after he had said his Office, for a little
talk. And when we had finished our supper
we sat together long over our wine, talking
now in French, now in English, now in Italian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
and occasionally understanding each other.
Like all good fellows, we too had our jokes.
But the <i>Abate&#39;s</i> favorite was to tell how he had
seen us coming up the mountain, <i>monsieur</i>
push-pushing the velocipede and <i>madame</i> puff-puffing
behind him. Even Dom Giuseppe,
the other monk,&mdash;the third was away,&mdash;relaxed
from the dignity with which he had first
met us, and took part in the talk and the
laughter. Unreal as seemed these late suppers
in the long refectory in the dim light, with
Pirro forever jumping after choice morsels,
while Lupo and his family growled with rage
and envy from under the table, we strayed even
farther into Wonderland the second day after
our arrival, when both monks went out for a
ride on the tricycle along the mulberry walk
and by Blessed Bernardo&#39;s grotto.</p>

<p class="indent">The last day of our stay a number of visitors
arrived,&mdash;a priest from Perugia, two nuns, and
two English ladies. They were not expected,
and dinner had to be prepared for them. The
<i>Abate</i> is never pleased when guests come without
giving him warning. When we met him
in the refectory a little after twelve, we could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
see his patience had been tried. We must pardon
him for being late, he said, but he had had
to find something to eat for all these people.
Were they to dine with us? we asked. No,
indeed, was his answer; they were not members
of the community. This confirmed our
doubts as to whether we might not be monks
without knowing it; for the first morning the
<i>Abate</i> had given us a key of the great front
door by which we could let ourselves in at all
hours, without any ringing of bells or calling
of porters; so that we felt as if we belonged to
the convent. These visitors were the thorns
in his present life, the <i>Abate</i> continued, and we
were his roses. Then he brought out a bottle
of the <i>vino santo</i> which he makes himself
and prizes so highly that he never sells it as
he does the other wines, and a plate of grapes
for which he had sent a great distance. And
when dinner was over he bade the servant put
all that was left of grapes and wine away.
They were for the community, and not for
common folk. He introduced us to the Perugian
priest, who might possibly, he said, be
of use to us in Perugia. The latter almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
embraced J. in his protestations of good-will,
and came running back several times to press
his hand, and say in a French of his own invention
that we must call often during our stay
in his city.</p>

<p class="indent">We left the monastery the next morning.
It took courage on our part; but we
knew it was best to go quickly. Every day
we fell more under the dreamy influence of
the place and became less willing for action.
We must hasten from Monte Oliveto for the
very reason which led Blessed Bernardo to it,&mdash;to
flee temptation. The <i>Abate</i> was in our
room by half-past seven. Dom Giuseppe was
in the church saying Mass, but had sent his
farewells. He himself had not yet said Mass,
so he could not drink his coffee with us, but
he sat by while we had ours. We should not
reach San Quirico till noon, he feared, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
must have something in our pockets to eat in
the mean time; and he went to his room and
came back with two cakes. He brought besides
two letters he had written introducing
us to monks at San Pietro in Perugia. Then
he came downstairs and out to the stable,
though he was fasting, and the morning was
wet and cloudy and cold. We did not get
on the tricycle at once. We remembered the
road too well. The <i>Abate</i> walked by our side,
now and then patting J. on the back and calling
him affectionately &quot;Giuseppe, Giuseppe;&quot;
and he kept with us until, at some little distance
from the gateway, we mounted the machine.
After he had said good-by, he stood
quietly watching us. Then there came a turn
in the road which hid him from us, and when
we saw him again he was walking on the footpath
below the cypresses, with two little boys
who had come out with him. He was on his
way to take Dom Giuseppe&#39;s place at the altar.
And then we went on sadly, for we knew we
should not come to another resting-place where
there was such perfect relief for pilgrims that
are weary and faint in the way.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
As the road was difficult going up, so was
it dangerous coming down, and again we had
to walk. To add to our discomfort, before
long it began to rain, and it was so cold we
had to blow on our fingers to keep them warm.
During the night it had snowed on the far
mountain-ranges. Beyond Buonconvento, when
we returned to the post-road we went fast
enough; but only for a while. There were
more mountains to cross, up which J. could
not go very fast because of the burden, or
knapsack, that was on his back. Out of very
shame I took my share in pushing and pulling
the tricycle. Once or twice we had long
coasts; but in places the road was sandy, and
in descending wound as often as a small St.
Gothard railway. Coasting would have been
too great a risk, especially as I never could
back-pedal going down hill, though on upgrades
J. but too often complained that, like
Dante on the hillside, my firm foot ever was
the lower.</p>

<span class="ralign"><i>Page 96.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The way still lay between and over hills of
chalk, and we rode for miles through monotonous
barrenness. It rained at intervals, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
at times the sun almost broke through the
clouds that followed it in long gray sweeps
from the white masses on the snow-capped
mountains bounding the horizon. To our
right, Monte Amiata, bare and rugged, and
with white top, was always in sight; and once
above it the clouds rolled away leaving a broad
stretch of greenish blue sky. There were
many crosses by the wayside, and they were
different from any we had yet seen. On each,
over spear and sponge and crown of thorns,
was a black cock, rudely carved to look as if it
crowed. Just before we came to San Quirico,
and towards noon, we saw at the foot of one of
these crosses an old weary-looking peasant, with
head bowed as if he listened for the Angelus.</p>

<p class="indent">We were prepossessed against San Quirico
before we reached it. Olives with vines hanging
from them in defiance of Virgil, brown
fields, and red and yellow trees, could not
reconcile us to the long climb up the mountain.
It was worth our trouble, however, if
only to see the cathedral. We left the tricycle
at the <i>trattoria</i>, and at our leisure looked at
the portal and its pillars, with quaintly carved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
capitals of animals and birds, and at those
others, joined together with a Celtic-like twist
and resting on leopards, and then at the two
sea-monsters above. And while we wondered
at the grotesque gargoyles on the walls, and
the two figures for columns, and the lions on
the south doorway, two <i>carabinieri</i> from a
neighboring window examined us as if we were
equal curiosities. This fine building is an incongruity
in San Quirico, which&mdash;for our first
impressions proved right&mdash;is at best but a
poor place. We were cheated in it as we had
never been before. When we went back to
the <i>trattoria</i> four men were eating their dinner
inside the fireplace in the kitchen. But we
were ushered into what I suppose was the best
room. It was dining-room and bed-chamber
combined. On one side was a long table, on
the other the bed. The dressing-table served
as buffet, and the <i>padrona</i> brought from its
drawers the cheese and apples for our dessert.
In the garden below&mdash;for we were in the
second story&mdash;weeds like corn grew so tall
that they shaded the window. What happened
in that room, and the difference that arose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
between the <i>padrona</i> and ourselves, are facts
too unpleasant to recall. But I am sure the
next foreigners who went to San Quirico heard
woful tales of the evil doings of the two <i>Inglesi</i>
who came on a velocipede.</p>

<p class="indent">After San Quirico there was the same barrenness,
and only indifferent roads over rolling
country. Until within half a mile of Pienza,
where the hedges began again, not a tree grew
by the roadside, and the only signs of vegetation
were the reeds in the little dark pools
dotting the gray fields. It was still bitterly
cold, and my fingers tingled on the handles.
Once we passed a farm-house where a solitary
woman watched a herd of black swine, and
once we met the diligence; that was all.</p>

<p class="indent">We rode into Pienza, though our way lay to
one side of it. But we were curious to see the
cathedrals and palaces Pius II. built there in
the vain hope of turning his native village into
an important town. Of all the follies of proud
popes, I think this was the greatest. As well
might he have hoped by his single effort to
cover the <i>creta</i>, or chalk, with roses, as to raise
a prosperous city in its midst. We saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
great brown buildings marked with the fine
crescents of the Piccolomini and the papal
tiara and keys, as out of place in Pienza as the
cathedral seemed in San Quirico; we looked
closer at the old stone well and its beautiful
wrought-iron work. J. made a sketch of a fine
courtyard, and then we were on the road again.</p>

<p class="indent">Near Montepulciano we came to a thickly
wooded country, riding for several miles between
chestnuts and oaks. There were open
places, too, from which we saw far below the
fair Val di Chiana, and in the distance Lake
Thrasymene, pale and silvery, and close by
olive-gardens, through whose gray branches
we looked at the purple mountains and their
snowy summits. Above were broad spaces of
bright sky, for the dark clouds were rolling
away beyond the lake, and those that floated
around Monte Amiata were now glistening
and white. We had left the wilderness for a
garden. All the bells rang out as if in welcome
when, after working up the long road, so
winding that at times the city was completely
hidden, we wheeled into the now dark and cold
streets of Montepulciano.</p>

<h2>WE ARE DETAINED IN MONTEPULCIANO.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;They were therefore here in evil</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>case, and were far from friends and</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>acquaintances.&quot;</i></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;Why, truly, I do not know</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>what had become of me there, had</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>not Evangelist happily met me.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It was in this high hill town that one of the
pilgrims fell by the way. For two days
J. was too ill to ride, and we feared our pilgrimage
had come to an end. We stayed at
the Albergo Marzocco. It was on the fifth
floor of an old palace, and the entrance was
through the kitchen. The <i>padrone</i> and his
family were very sociable. Almost immediately
his wife wanted to know the trade of the
<i>Signore</i>. &quot;Ah! an artist. <i>Ecco me!</i> I am a
washerwoman!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was also cook. From the dining-room
we could watch her as she prepared our meals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
When she kept us waiting too long we had
only to step into the kitchen and stand over
her until the dish we had ordered was ready.
We could look too into an adjacent room
where during our stay one daughter of the
house forever ironed table-cloths, while a second
added up endless accounts.</p>

<p class="indent">But friendly as these people were, they were
stupid. The <i>padrone</i> had a <i>pizzicheria</i>, or
pork-shop, across the street. When anything
was wanted at the Albergo it was brought
from the shop. Every time I went to my
window I saw messengers on their way between
the two establishments. But no man
can serve two masters; the <i>pizzicheria</i> drove
a more thriving trade, and the Albergo suffered
in consequence. It was left in the charge of
a youth of unparalleled stupidity, who seldom
understood what we asked for, and when he
did, declared it something not to be had. But
a friend was sent to us in our need.</p>

<p class="indent">It happened in this way. The first morning
we went out for a walk. As we started, and
were passing the palace with the Etruscan inscriptions
on the heavy stones of its lower wall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
a Harlequin newly painted in red and white
struck nine from a house-top near by. In the
Via dell&#39; Erbe women, their heads covered
with gay handkerchiefs or wide-brimmed, high-crowned
felt hats, were selling vegetables and
fruit. Just in front of us, walking hand in
hand, were three beggars, two blind and one
lame, and an old brown monk with a wine-cask
on his shoulder. At almost every turn we
saw through an archway the three far-away
lakes of Montepulciano, Chiusi, and Thrasymene.
But it was now J. began to feel ill,
and we went to a <i>caffè</i> and called for cognac.
As we sat there the door opened and a
young Italian dressed <i>à l&#39;Anglaise</i>, even to his
silver-headed cane, came in. He took a seat
at the table next to us. When his coffee was
brought he asked the waiter if he had seen
the English lady and gentleman who arrived
the evening before on a velocipede. No, the
waiter had not; he knew nothing of these foreigners.
There was a pause, while the young
Italian sipped his coffee. But presently he
turned to us and said in good English, but
with a marked accent:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
&quot;I beg pardon, sare, but was it not you who
came to Montepulciano on a tricycle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said J., but rather curtly, for he was
just then very miserably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, I thought so!&quot; continued the Italian,
well satisfied with the answer. &quot;I have seen it,&mdash;a
Humber. It is a beautiful machine. I
myself do ride a bicycle,&mdash;the <i>Speecial Cloob</i>.
You know it? I do belong to the Cyclists&#39;
<i>Touring Cloob</i> and to the <i>Speedvell Cloob</i>. All
the English champions do belong to that <i>Cloob</i>.
I did propose some one for director at the
last meeting; you will see my name on that
account in the papers. Here is my card, but
in the country around Montepulciano all call
me Sandro or Sandrino. I have ridden from
Florence to Montepulciano in one day. I
have what you call the wheel fever,&quot;&mdash;and he
smiled apologetically and stopped, but only to
take breath.</p>

<p class="indent">We were fellow-cyclers, and that was enough.
He was at once our friend, though our greeting
in return was not enthusiastic, and our
record would have disgusted the <i>Speedvell
Cloob</i>. He could sympathize. He was feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
<i>vary bad</i> himself, because the day before he
had gone on his bicycle as far as Montalcino
with a gun to <i>keel the leetle birds</i>. It was too
far even for a champion. But he had taken
the waters&mdash;Janos: he had great faith in the
waters.</p>

<p class="indent">The cognac by this time had made J. better,
and we started to leave the <i>caffè</i>. Sandrino,
to give him his Montepulciano name,
insisted on paying for everything. We must
let him have that favor, he said, and also another.
He was not a native of the town,&mdash;he
was a Roman, as he supposed we could see by
his nose,&mdash;but still he would like to do us the
honors of the place. He would take us to see
so fine a church we could not but be pleased
with it; it was only a step. Foolishly we
went. The step was a long one. It took us
half-way down the mountain-side to the Madonna
di San Biagio. But J. was now really
too wretched to look at anything, and we
turned back at once. As we walked slowly
up again, Sandrino explained that he had lived
in England several years; and it turned out
that he had the English as well as the wheel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
fever. All his clothes were from London, he
said, even his flannels; and he pulled down his
sleeve that we might see. He smoked English
tobacco,&mdash;a friend sent it to him; and he
showed us the small paper box tied with a
string in which he kept it. And most of his
news was English, too. His friends wrote
him. He had just had a letter&mdash;see&mdash;and he
opened it. There had been fearful riots in
England. He cared much for the politics of
the country. But the refrain of all he said was
praise of cycling. He offered to ride with us
when we left Montepulciano. He could go
any day but the next, which was his twenty-first
birthday, when he was to have a great
dinner and many friends and much wine. He
would call, if we would allow him; and with
profession of great friendship he left us at the
door of the Albergo.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">He was true to his word. Indeed, I do not
know what had become of us but for his
kindness. After our return from our walk, J.
was unable to leave his room. We were
both depressed by this unlooked-for delay, and
Sandrino not only helped to amuse, but was of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
practical use to us. He came twice the following
day. The first time he stopped, he said, to
tell us he did hear from friends in Castiglione
del Lago, who, if we should ride to-morrow,
would be glad to see us at lunch. &quot;There will
be nothing much,&quot; he concluded; &quot;they will
make no preparations. It will be some <i>leetle</i>
thing.&quot; Though in the first glory of his
twenty-one years, he went with me to a druggist&#39;s
to act as interpreter. But I think he
was repaid by his pleasure in carrying back a
bottle of his favorite waters. The boy, when
he saw it, with his usual cleverness followed
into the room bringing three glasses. If we
had asked for three he doubtless would have
brought one. Sandrino&#39;s second visit was in
the evening after he had eaten his great dinner
and drunk much wine, which had again made
him feel <i>vary bad</i>. Had we ever tasted the
famous Montepulciano, &quot;king of all wine&quot;? he
asked. No? Well, then, we must before leaving
the town. It was not to be had anywhere
else, and indeed even in Montepulciano could
not be bought in the <i>caffè</i> or shops. He had
been presented with many bottles.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
He repeated his invitation to lunch in Castiglione,
and it seemed that other friends in a
villa near Cortona would also be charmed to
see us, and to give us wine if we were tired.</p>

<h2>IN THE VAL DI CHIANA.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;Thy company, O sweet Evangelist,</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>how desirable it is to us poor</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>pilgrims.&quot;</i></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;Then I saw in my dream they</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>went very lovingly on together.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The next morning J. was much better, and
we decided to ride. Sandrino arrived
at half-past seven and breakfasted with us.
In the uniform of the <i>Speedvell Cloob</i>, its
monogram in silver on his cap, he was even
more English than he had been the day before.
Our last experience at the Albergo was
characteristic. The waiter, overcome by Sandrino&#39;s
appearance, became incapable of action.
We called for our coffee and rolls in vain.
Finally we all, our guest included, made a
descent upon the kitchen and forced him to
bestir himself.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Sunday morning, and the news of our
going had been noised abroad. The aristocracy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
as well as the people turned out to see us off.
Many of Sandrino&#39;s friends lingered in the
barber-shop across the street; others waited
just without the city gate with his mother and
sister. When Sandrino saw the crowd here,
he sprang upon his <i>Speecial Cloob</i>, worked with
one foot and waved the other in the air, rode
to the little park beyond and back, and then
jumped off, hat in hand, at his mother&#39;s side,
with the complacent smile of a champion.
Indeed, the whole ride that day savored of the
circus. He went down hills with his legs
stretched straight out on either side. On level
places he made circles and fancy figures in the
road. Whenever we passed peasants,&mdash;and
there were many going to church,&mdash;he shrieked
a warning shrill as a steam-engine whistle. No
wonder he said he had no use for a bell! He
spoke to all the women, calling them his
&quot;beautiful cousins.&quot; And in villages the noise
he made was so great that frightened people,
staring at him, could not look behind, so that
several times we all but rode over men and
women who walked backward right into our
wheels. And all the while J., like the ring-master,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
kept calling and shrieking, and no one
paid the least attention to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Our way was through the beautiful Val di
Chiana, no longer pestilential and full of stenches
as in Dante&#39;s day, but fresh and fair, and in
places sweet with clematis. There were no
fences or hedges, and it stretched from mountains
to mountains, one wide lovely park.
About half-way to Castiglione we came to the
boundary line between Tuscany and Umbria,&mdash;a
canal with tall poplars on its banks, throwing
long reflections into the water below, where a
boat lay by the reeds. We stopped there some
little time. Sandrino was polite, but I could
see he did not approve. What would the
<i>Speedvell Cloob</i> have thought? Farther on,
when we waited again near a low farm-house
under the oaks, he wheeled quickly on. But
presently he came back. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;I
thought you must have had an accident!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There could be no lovelier lake town than
Castiglione del Lago. The high hill on which
it stands projects far into Lake Thrasymene.
The olives which grow from its walls down the
hillside into the very water are larger and finer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
with more strangely twisted trunks, than any
I have ever seen. As we came near the town
we rode between them, looking beneath their
silvery-gray branches out to the pale blue lake
beyond. A woman came from under their
shade with a bundle of long reeds on her head;
a priest passed us on a donkey.</p>

<p class="indent">We left our machines in a stable at the foot
of the hill and walked through the streets.
Here Sandrino&#39;s invitation came to nought;
his friends were away. Whatever <i>leetle thing</i>
we had must be found elsewhere. So we went
to a <i>trattoria</i>, where another of his friends,
a serious, polite young man who, we learned
afterwards, owns the town and all the country
thereabout, sat and talked with us while we
ate our lunch. Poor Sandrino! He had to
pay for his English clothes and foreign friends!
The <i>padrona</i>, backed by her husband from the
kitchen below, asked him no less than five
francs for our macaroni and wine. A dispute,
loud because of the distance between the disputants,
followed; but in the end Sandrino
paid four francs, though half that sum would
have been enough. It was some consolation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
for us to know that, <i>forestieri</i> as we were, we
had never been cheated so outrageously, not
even in San Quirico.</p>

<p class="indent">It was pleasant wandering through the town,
with the grave young man as guide, to the
Palazzo Communale, where the red and white
flag of the Duke of Cornia waving outside was
the same as that painted in the old frescos
within, and where councilmen holding council
bowed to us as we passed; and then to the old
deserted castle which, with its gray battlemented
walls and towers, was not unlike an English
ruin. But it was pleasanter when, Sandrino
having kissed his friend, we were on the road
again, riding between yellow mulberries by
the side of the lake. Sheep were grazing on
the grassy banks; donkeys and oxen were at
rest in the meadows. But the peasants, Mass
heard, were at work again. Women on ladders
were stripping the mulberries of their
leaves; men on their knees were digging in
the fields.</p>

<p class="indent">At the villa, Sandrino&#39;s friends were at home.
At the gate the gay bicycler gave his war-cry.
A young lady ran out between the roses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
chrysanthemums in the garden and by the red
wall where yellow pumpkins were sunning, to
welcome him. Then her mother and sister
came and also gave him greeting. They received
us with courtesy. We were led into the
drawing-room, a bare, barn-like place with cold
brick floor, where there were three or four
chairs, a table, an old piano, faded cretonne
curtains hung on rough sticks at the windows,
and small drawings pinned on the walls. A
man in blue coat and trousers, such as the
peasants wear, followed us in and sat down by
the young ladies. He was one of her men, the
<i>Signora</i> explained. Then we had the wine
Sandrino promised, and we became very
friendly. One of the daughters knew a little
English, but when we spoke to her she hid her
face in her hands and laughed and blushed.
She never, never would dare to say a word
before us, she declared. She was very arch
and girlish. One minute she played a waltz
on the piano; the next she teased Sandrino,
and there was much pleasantry between them.
The mother spoke French after a fashion, but
when she had anything to say she relapsed into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
Italian. She lived in Rome, she said. We
must come and see her there. But would we
not now stay at her villa all night, instead of
in Cortona? Then she squeezed my hand.
&quot;<i>Vous êtes bien sympathique</i>,&quot; she said, and I
think she meant to compliment me. Her
husband, it seems, was a banker in Rome,
and would be pleased, so she told us through
Sandrino&#39;s interpretation, to do anything and
everything for us.</p>

<p class="indent">Mother and daughters, men and maids, all
walking amiably together, came to the garden
gate with us. The <i>Signora</i> here squeezed
my hand a second time. The skittish young
lady said &quot;good-by&quot; and then hid behind a
bush, and her sister gave us each some roses.
It was here too we were to part with Sandrino.
He must be back in Montepulciano by six;
more friends were coming. Would we write
him postal cards to tell him of the distance and
time we made? And that map of Tuscany we
said we would give him, would we not remember
it? He was going to take some great
rides, and it would help him. Then we turned
one way, and he, riding his best for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
young ladies, the other, to be seen by us no
more.</p>

<p class="indent">It was roses all the way to Cortona. They
grew in villa gardens and along the road up
the mountain; there were a few even among
the olives, on the terraces whose stone embankments
make the city from below look as if it
were surrounded by many walls instead of one
only. Near the town we met two young lovers,
their arms around each other&#39;s waists, and a
group of men who directed us in our search
for the inn up a short steep hill leading away
from the main road. Above, inside the city
gate, several other citizens told us we must go
down again, for the road we had left led right
by the door. Clearly the Albergo della Stella&mdash;for
that was its name&mdash;was not well known
in Cortona. After a climb of three miles it was
provoking to go even a foot out of our way,
and we turned back in no cheerful mood. It
was more disheartening when, having finally
come to the Albergo, we found the lower floor,
by which we entered, the home of pigs and
donkeys and oxen. The major was right, I
thought; Cortona was a rough place.  The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
contrast when on the third floor of this establishment
we were shown into a large, clean,
really well-furnished room with window overlooking
the valley, made us neglect to drive
a close bargain with the <i>padrona</i>,&mdash;a neglect
for which we suffered later.</p>

<h2>LUCA SIGNORELLI&#39;S TOWN.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;By this time the pilgrims had a</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>desire to go forward.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The principal event of our stay in Cortona
was a hunt for Luca Signorelli&#39;s house.
Why we were so anxious to find it I did not
know then, nor do I now; but we were very
earnest about it. At the start a youth
pursued us with the persistence of a government
spy. It was useless to try and dodge
him. No matter how long we were in
churches or by what door we came out, he
was always waiting in exactly the right place.
In our indignation we would not ask him
the way, but we did of some other boys, who
forthwith led us such a wild-goose chase
that I think before it was over there was
not a street or corner of the town unvisited
by us.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
We next employed an old man as guide.
Of course he knew all about Luca Signorelli.
He could show us all his frescos and pictures
in Cortona. Some of them were bad enough,
as he supposed the <i>Signore</i> knew; they were
painted in the artist&#39;s youth. But we wanted
to see his house? Ah! we had but to follow
him, and he led us in triumph to that of Pietro
da Cortona. As this would not do, he consulted
with an old woman, who recommended
a visit to a certain <i>padre</i>. The <i>padre</i> was
in his kitchen. He had never heard of
Signorelli&#39;s house, and honestly admitted his
ignorance. But could he show us some fine
frescos or sell us antiquities? This failing,
our guide hunted for some friends who, he
declared, knew everything. But they were not
in their shop, nor in the <i>caffè</i>, nor on the
piazza, and in despair he took us to see another
priest. The latter wore a jockey-cap and goggles,
and was a learned man. He had heard
of a life of Signorelli by a German. He had
never read it, nor indeed could he say where
it was to be had; but he knew there was such
a book. He was certain our hunt was useless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
since Signorelli had lived in so many houses
the city could not afford to put tablets on them
all, and so not one was marked. He himself
was a professional letter-writer, and if the
<i>Signore</i> had any letters he wished written&mdash;?
We then gave up the search and dismissed
the old man with a franc, though he declared
himself still willing to continue it. It was in
this way we saw Cortona.</p>

<p class="indent">For the last few days we had begun to be
haunted by the fear of the autumn rains. If
they were as bad as Virgil says, and were to
fall in dense sheets, tearing the crops up by
the roots, while black whirlwinds set the stubble
flying, and vast torrents filled ditches and
raised rivers, the roads must certainly be made
unridable. Since the morning we left Monte
Oliveto the weather had been threatening, and
now in Cortona there were heavy showers. As
we sat in our room at the Albergo after our
long tramp, and J. made a sketch from the
window, we saw dark clouds gradually cover
the sky. The lake, so blue yesterday, was
gray and dull. The valley and the mountains
were in shadow, save where the sun breaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
through the clouds shone on a small square
of olives and spread a golden mist over Monte
Amiata. Before J. had finished, the gold
faded into white and then deepened into purple,
and we determined to be off early in the
morning.</p>

<h2>TO PERUGIA: BY TRAIN AND
TRICYCLE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;Now you must note that the</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>City stood upon a mighty hill, but</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>the pilgrims went up that hill with</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>ease.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The next day I was tired and in no humor
for riding. J. wanted once to try the
tricycle without luggage over the Italian roads.
It was settled then between us that I should
go alone by train to Perugia, where we should
meet. Before seven we had our breakfast and
the <i>padrona</i> brought us her bill. Because we
had not bargained in the beginning she overcharged
us for everything; but we refused to
pay more than we knew was her due. There
was the inevitable war of words, more unpleasant
than usual because her voice was loud and
harsh and asthmatic. She grew tearful before
it was over, but finally thanked us for what
we gave her, and asked us to come again so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
gently that we mistrusted her. I thought it
wise to wait with the bags at the station,
though my train would not start till eleven.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a beautiful coast down the mountain
between the olives, four miles with feet up.
The clouds had rolled away during the night,
and it was bright and warm at the station
when J. left me to go on his way. It was
quiet too, and for some time I was alone with
the porters. But presently a young woman
with a child in her arms came by. She stopped
and looked at me sympathetically. I spoke to
her, and then she came nearer and patted me
on the shoulder and said, &quot;<i>Poverina!</i>&quot; It
seems she had seen J. bring me to the
station and then turn back by himself. I do
not know what she thought was the trouble,
but she felt sorry for me. She was the wife
of the telegraph operator, and lived in rooms
above the station. She took me to them, and
then she brought me an illustrated translation
of &quot;Gil Blas&quot; to look at while she made me a
cup of coffee. Every few minutes she sighed
and said again, &quot;<i>Poverina!</i>&quot; She gave me
her card,&mdash;Elena Olas, <i>nata</i> Bocci, was her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
name. I wrote mine on a slip of paper, and
when the train, only an hour late, came, we
parted with great friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">A regiment of soldiers was on its way to
Perugia and made the journey very lively.
Peasants who had somehow heard of its coming
were in wait at every station with apples
and chestnuts and wine, over which there was
much noisy bargaining. At other times the
soldiers sang. As the train carried us by the
lake from which the mountains in the distance
rose white and shadowy and phantom-like,
and by Passignano,&mdash;built right in the water,
with reeds instead of flowers around the houses,
where fishermen were out in their boats near
the weirs,&mdash;and then by Maggiore and Ellora
on their hill-tops, I heard the constant refrain
of the soldiers&#39; song, and it reminded me of my
friend at Cortona, for it was a plaintive regret
for &quot;<i>Poverina mia!</i>&quot; Then there came a
pause in the singing, and a voice called out,
&quot;<i>Ecco</i>, Perugia!&quot; I looked from the carriage
window, and there, far above on the mountain,
I saw it, white and shining, like a beautiful city
of the sun.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
At the station J. met me. He had been
waiting an hour, having made the thirty-six
miles between Cortona and Perugia in three
hours and a half. He too had had his adventures.
Beyond Passignano he met a man on
foot who spoke to him, and to whom he said,
&quot;<i>Buon Giorno</i>.&quot; &quot;Good-morning,&quot; cried the
man in good cockney English, and J. in
sheer astonishment stopped the tricycle. The
tramp&mdash;for tramp he was&mdash;explained that he
was an Englishman and in a bad way. He
had been at Perugia with a circus which had
little or no success, and the rascally Frenchman
who managed it had broken up and made
off, leaving him with nothing. He was now
on his way to Florence, where he wanted to be
taken on by Prince Strozzi, who kept English
jockeys. But in the mean time he was hungry
and had no money, and must tramp it all
the way. J. bethought him of the card to the
gentleman of Cortona who had married an
English wife. We had not used it, and it
seemed a pity to waste it. The English lady
doubtless would be glad of an opportunity
to help a countryman. So he gave it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
tramp, together with a franc for his immediate
wants. The latter looked at the money. He
supposed he could do something with it, he
grumbled. He really was grateful, however,
for he offered to push the machine up a hill
down which he had just walked. But J. telling
him to hurry on, engaged instead the services
of a small boy who was going his way. For
pay, he gave the child a coast down the other
side into his native village, than which <i>soldi</i>
could not have been sweeter. Did not all his
playmates see him ride by in his pride?</p>

<p class="indent">Arriving in Perugia, J. himself was a hero
for a time. Many officers with their wives
were in the station, and in their curiosity so
far forgot their usual dignity as to surround
him and pester him with questions as to his
whence and whither and what speed he could
make.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">It is a long way from the station up the
mountain to the town, but we went faster than
we ever climbed mountain before, for we tied
the tricycle to the back of the diligence. J.
rode and steered it, but I sat inside, ending my
day&#39;s journey as I had begun it, in commonplace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
fashion. The driver was full of admiration.
We must go to Terni on our velocipede,
he said; in the mountains beyond Spoleto we
should go down-hill for seven miles. <i>Ecco!</i>
no need of a diligence then!</p>

<h2>AT PERUGIA.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;And did see such things there,</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>the remembrance of which will</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>stick by me as long as I live.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The <i>padrone</i> of the Albergo at Perugia
was a man of parts. He could speak
English. When we complimented him on a
black cat which was always in his office, he
answered, with eyes fixed on vacancy, and
pausing between each word like a child saying
its lesson: &quot;Yes-it-is-a-good-cat. I-have-one-dog-and-four-cats.
This-cat-is-the-fath-er-of-the-oth-er-cats.
One-are-red-and-three-is-white.&quot;
And when we had occasion to thank
him, he knew enough to tell us we were very
much obliged.</p>

<p class="indent">But we gave him small chance to display
his powers. There was little to keep us in the
Albergo, when, after a few minutes&#39; walk we
could be in the piazza, where the sun shone on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
Pisano&#39;s fountain, and on the Palazzo of the
Baglioni and the Duomo opposite. But what
a fall was there! A couple of <i>gendarmes</i>,
priests walking two by two, a few beggars,
were the only people we saw in this broad
piazza, where at one time men and women,
driven to frenzy by the words of Saint Bernardino,
spoken from the pulpit by the Duomo
door, almost fell into the fire they had kindled
to burn their false hair and ornaments, their
dice and cards; and where at another Baglioni
fought, with the young Raphael looking
on to paint later one at least of the combatants;
and where the beautiful Grifonetto lay
in death agony, the avengers of his murdered
kinsmen waiting to see him die, the heads of
his fellow-assassins looking grimly down from
the Palazzo walls, and Atalanta, his mother,
giving him forgiveness for the deed, for which
but yesterday she had cursed him. In the aisles
of the Duomo, once so stained with the blood of
the Baglioni that they had to be purified with
wine before prayers could again be offered in
them, a procession of white-robed priests and
acolytes, bearing cross and censer, passed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
one chapel to another before a congregation
of two or three old women. It was the same
in the narrow streets; all is now still and
peaceful where of old Baglioni, single-handed,
kept back the forces of Oddi, their mortal foes.
Only the memory of their fierceness remains;
though I have two friends who say that in the
dark street behind the Palazzo, where brave
Simonetto and Astore fought the enemy until
corpses lay in piles around them, they one
night heard voices singing sadly, as if in
lamentation; and these voices led them onwards
under one archway and then another
until suddenly the sounds ceased. But when
they turned to go homewards, lo! they had
lost their way. The next morning they returned
that they might by daylight see whence
the music could have come. But all along the
street was a dead wall. None but spirits could
have sung there; and what spirits would dare to
lift their voices in this famous street but those
of Baglioni?</p>

<p class="indent">It must be the degeneracy of modern warriors
that sets these heroes of the old school
to singing lamentations. The Grifonettos and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
Astores who feasted on blood, could they
come back to life and their native town, would
have little sympathy with the captains and
colonels who now drink tamarind-water in the
<i>caffè</i>, booted and spurred though the latter be.
The <i>caffè</i> is everywhere the lounging-place
of Italian officers, but in Perugia it seemed to
be their headquarters. There was one on the
Corso, a few doors from the Palazzo, which
they specially patronized. They were there
in the morning even before the shops were
opened, and again at noon, and yet again in
the evening, while at other times they walked
to and fro in front of it, as if on guard. But
though the youngest as well as the oldest patronized
it, the distinctions of rank between
them were observed as scrupulously as Dickens
says they are with the Chatham and Rochester
aristocracy. The colonel associated with nothing
lower than a major, the latter in turn drawing
the line at the captain, and so it went
down to the third lieutenant, who lorded it
only over the common soldier. On the whole,
I think the lesser officers had the best of it;
for whether they eat cakes and drank sweet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
drinks, or played cards, they were always
sociable and merry. Whereas, sometimes the
colonel sat solitary in his grandeur, silent
except for the few words with the boy selling
matches as he hunted through the stock to
find a box with a pretty picture.</p>

<p class="indent">We were long enough in Perugia to carry
the <i>Abate&#39;s</i> letters to San Pietro. The monks
to whom they were written were away, but a
third came in their place and gave us welcome.
He showed J. the inner cloister, to
which I could not go: women were not allowed
there. It was because of my skirts, he
said; and yet he too wore skirts, and he spread
out his cassock on each side. While they
were gone I waited in the church. I wonder
if ghostly voices are never heard within it.
The monks, long dead, whose love and even
life it was to make it beautiful until its walls
and ceilings were rich and glowing, its choir a
miracle of carving, and its sacristy hung with
prayer-inspiring pictures, have, like the Baglioni,
cause to bewail the degenerate latter day.
The beauty they created now lives but for the
benefit of a handful of monks whose monastery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
is turned into a Boys&#39; Agricultural School,
and for the occasional tourist. Later from the
high terrace of the park opposite San Pietro
we saw the boys in their blue blouses digging
and hoeing in the fields under the olives, where
probably the monks themselves once worked.
There is in this little park an amphitheatre
with archway, bearing the Perugian griffin in
the centre. It is shaded by dense ilex-trees,
from whose branches a raven must once have
croaked; for evil has come upon the place, as
it has upon the gray monastery so near. Instead
of nobles and men-at-arms and councillors
of state, two or three poor women with
their babies sat on the stone benches gossiping.
And as we lingered there in the late
afternoon there came from San Pietro the
sound, not of monks chanting vespers, but of
some one playing the &quot;Blue Danube&quot; on an
old jingling piano. Only the valley below,
and the Tiber winding through it, and the
mountains beyond are unchanged.</p>

<h2>ACROSS THE TIBER TO ASSISI.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;And I slept and dreamed again</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>and saw the same two pilgrims going</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>down the mountains along the</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>highway towards the city.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">When we left Perugia in the early morning
we passed first by the statue of
Julius II., thus receiving, we said to each other,
the bronze pontiff&#39;s benediction. We imagined
this to be an original idea; but it is useless
to try to be original. Since then we have
remembered the same thought came to Miriam
and Donatello when they made the statue
their trysting-place. Then we rode through
the piazza, where a market was being held, and
where at one end a long row of women holding
baskets of eggs stood erect, though all around
other women and even men, selling fruits and
vegetables, sat comfortably on low stools.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Bronze Pontiff&#39;s Benediction, Perugia.</span>
<span class="ralign"><i>Page 134.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">On the other side of the Porta Romana we
saw that while Perugia was bright and clear in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
the sunlight, a thick white mist covered the
valley, so that it looked as if a great lake,
bounded by the mountains, lay below. The
chrysanthemums and marigolds, hanging over
high garden walls, and the grass by the road-side
glistened with dew. Shining silver cobwebs
hung on the hedges. Before many
minutes, so fast did we go, we were riding
right into the mist. We could see but a few
feet in front of us, and the olives on either side,
through the heavy white veil, looked like spectres.
We passed no one but a man carrying a
lantern and a cage of owls. It seemed but
natural that so uncanny a ride should lead to a
home of shadows. And when we came to the
tomb of the Volumnii at the foot of the mountain
we left the tricycle without, and went down
for a while into its darkness and damp. When
we came out the mist had disappeared and the
road lay through sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent">A little farther on we had our first near
view of the Tiber. We crossed it by the old
Ponte San Giovanni, so narrow that there
was not room for us to pass a boy and a
donkey just in front.  J. called, and the boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
pushed his donkey close to the stone wall; but
for all that we could not pass. Even as J.
called he was stopped by a sudden sharp pain
in his side, the result probably of his descent
into the tomb while he was still warm; for he
had back-pedalled coming down the mountain.
And so we waited for many minutes on the
bridge to see, not the yellow Tiber one always
hears about, but a river blue in mid-stream,
white where it came running over the mill-wheel
and down the dam, and red and yellow
and green where it reflected the poplars and
oaks, and the skirts and handkerchiefs of the
women washing on its banks. But after the
bridge we left the river, for we were bound for
Assisi. We had a quiet, peaceful ride for several
miles on the Umbrian plain, where in the
old times no one dared to go without the permission
of the Baglioni, between vineyards and
fields where men were ploughing, and through
insignificant little villages, until we came out
upon the large piazza in front of Santa Maria
degli Angeli. It was crowded with peasants,
for market was just over, and there came from
every side the sound of many voices. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
we rode by we were surrounded at once, two
or three men keeping close to our side to sing
the praises of the hotels at Assisi and shower
their cards upon us. They pursued us even
into the church, and as far as the little hermitage
beneath the dome, to tell us that each
and all could speak English.</p>

<span class="ralign"><i>Page 136.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">If the Umbrians about Assisi were always
like this, Saint Francis was a wise man to hide
himself in the woods and make friends with
beasts and birds. Over the sunny roads beyond
Santa Maria, where he and Fra Egidio
walked singing and exhorting men and women
to repentance, we wheeled imploring, or rather
commanding, them to get out of the way. It
was a hard pull up the mountain-side, the
harder because the great monastery on its high
foundations seemed always so far above us.
When almost at the city gate a monk in brown
robes, the knotted cord about his waist, passed.
He stopped to look, but it was with a frown of
disapproval; I think Saint Francis would have
smiled.</p>

<h2>AT ASSISI.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;Methought these things did ravish</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>my heart; I would have stayed</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>at that man&#39;s house a twelvemonth</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>but that I knew I had farther</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>to go.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It was just noon when we reached Assisi, but
we rode no more that day. We spent the
afternoon in the town of Saint Francis. The
Albergo we selected from the many recommended
was without the large cloisters of the
monastery. The waiter at once remembered
that J. had been there before, though eighteen
months had passed since his first visit. The
<i>Signore</i> had two ladies with him then, he said.
He was delighted with the velocipede. It was
the first time in all his life he had seen one
with three wheels. Nothing would do but he
must show us the finest road to Rome. He
spread our map on the table as we eat our dinner,
and put on his glasses,&mdash;for he was a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
bad in the eyes, he explained,&mdash;and then he
pointed out the very route we had already decided
upon. <i>Ecco!</i> here, between Spoleto and
Terni, we should have a long climb up the
mountain, but then there would be seven miles
down the other side. Ah! that would be fine!
This long coast to Terni was clearly to make
up for the hardships we already had endured
on toilsome up-grades.</p>

<p class="indent">After dinner we went to the church. Goethe,
when he was in Assisi, saw the old Roman
Temple of Minerva,&mdash;and then, that his pleasure
in it might not be disturbed, refused to look
at anything else in the town, and went quickly
on his way. But when I passed out of the sunlight
into the dark lower church and under the
low rounded arches to the altar with Giotto&#39;s
angels and saints above, it seemed to me he
was the loser by his great love for classic
beauty. Many who have been to this wonderful
church have written descriptions of it, but
none have really told, and indeed no one can
ever tell, how wonderful it is. The upper
church, with its great lofty nave and many windows
through which the light streams in on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
the bright frescoed walls, is beautiful. But this
lower one, with its dark, subdued color and dim
light, and the odor of incense which always lingers
in it, is like the embodiment of the mystery
and love that inspired the saint in whose
honor it was built. In it one understands, for
the first time perhaps, what it is for which
the followers of Saint Francis gave up life and
action. Whoever was long under the influence
of this place must, I thought, always stay,&mdash;like
the old gray-haired monk we saw kneeling
before a side altar rapt in contemplation.
And yet on the very threshold we found three
or four brothers laughing and joking with two
women,&mdash;Italian Dr. Mary Walkers they must
have been, for they wore men&#39;s collars and
cravats and coats, with field-glasses slung over
their shoulders, and stiff gray hats, and they
were smoking long <i>sigare Cavour</i>. They were
artists, and had been painting, oh, so badly! in
the church all the morning.</p>

<p class="indent">The sun was setting when we left the monastery
and walked through the streets, now
silent and deserted, where Francis in his gay
youth wandered with boon companions, singing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
not hymns but love-songs. A small boy came
and walked with us, and, unbidden, acted as our
guide. Here was the Duomo, he said, and
here the Church of Santa Chiara; and, when we
were on the road without the city gate, <i>Ecco!</i>
below, Santa Maria degli Angeli! For from
where we stood we looked down upon the
huge church rising from the plain, where even
now there are scarcely more houses than in the
days when Franciscans, coming from far and
near to hold counsel with their founder, built
their straw huts upon it. Our self-appointed
guide was a bright little fellow, and never once
begged like the other children who followed us.
So when he showed us the road to Foligno
where we must ride on the morrow, J. gave
him a <i>sou</i>. At the door of the Albergo he
said he must go home, but not to supper; he
never had any. He asked at what time we
should leave in the morning, when he would
like to come and say good-by. <i>Felice notte</i>&mdash;&quot;a
happy night&quot;&mdash;were his last words as he
turned away.</p>

<p class="indent">The next morning, with a select company
of ragged boys, our young guide arrived
in time to see us start. When I came out
he nodded in a friendly way, as if to an old
acquaintance, to the wonder and admiration of
the other youngsters. The waiter, his glasses
on, came to the gate with us. Two monks
standing there asked how far we were going
on our velocipede. &quot;To Rome?&quot; they cried.
&quot;Why, then, here are two pilgrims and two
priests!&quot; Our guide and his friend ran down
the mountain-side after us until we gave the
former another <i>sou</i>, when they at once disappeared.
It seemed a little ungrateful; but
I did not give him much thought, for just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
then J. bade me back-pedal with all my might.
The machine went very fast, despite my hard
work, and to my surprise J. suddenly steered
into a stone-pile by the roadside. &quot;The brake
is broken!&quot; was his explanation as we slowly
upset.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately, however, the upright connecting
the band of the brake with the handle had only
slipped out of place, and though we could not
fix it in again securely, J. could still manage
to use it. This, so far as we could see, was the
one defect in our tricycle, but defect it was.
A nut on the end of the upright would have
prevented such an accident. But this is one of
the minor particulars in which tricycle-makers&mdash;and
we have tried many&mdash;are careless.
We had the rest of the coast without interruption.
Half-way down, our little friend and his
followers ran out from under the olives; he had
taken a short cut that he might see us again.</p>

<p class="indent">From Assisi to Terni was a long day&#39;s ride
by towns and villages, through fair valleys and
over rough mountains. From the foot of the
mountain at Assisi, past Monte Subasio, which,
bare and rocky, towered above the lower olive-covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
hills, the road was level until we rode
by Spello with its old Roman gateway and
ruined amphitheatre. But the hill here was
not steep, and then again there came a level
stretch into Foligno, the first lowland town to
which we had come since we left Poggibonsi,
and which, with its mass of roofs and lofty dome
rising high above the city walls, looked little
like the Foligno in Raphael&#39;s picture. Already
in our short ride&mdash;for it is but ten miles from
Assisi to Foligno&mdash;we noticed a great difference
in the people. It was not only that
many of the women wore bodices and long earrings,
and turned their handkerchiefs up on
top of their heads, but they, and the men as
well, were less polite and more stupid than
the Tuscans or Umbrians about Perugia.</p>

<p class="indent">Few spoke to us, and one woman to whom
we said good-morning was so startled that she
thanked us in return, as if unused to such
civilities. For all J.&#39;s shouts of <i>a destra</i>&mdash;to
the right&mdash;and <i>Eccomi!</i> they would not make
room for us; and now in Foligno one woman,
in her stupidity or obstinacy, walked directly
in front of the machine, and when the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
wheel caught her dress, through no fault of
ours, cried &quot;<i>Accidente voi!</i>&quot;&mdash;the <i>voi</i>, instead
of <i>le</i>, being a far greater insult than the wishing
us an accident. Then she walked on,
cursing in loud voice, down the street, by the
little stream that runs through the centre of
the town, and into the market-place where
Saint Francis, in mistaken obedience to words
heard in ecstasy, sold the cloth he had taken
from his father that he might have money
to rebuild the church of San Damiano.</p>

<p class="indent">Even the beasts we met were stupid as the
people. At our coming, horses, donkeys, and
oxen tried to run. We therefore looked for at
least a skirmish when, beyond Foligno, a regiment
of cavalry in marching order advanced
upon us. But the soldiers stood our charge
bravely. Only the officer was routed and retreated
into the gutter. Then, forgetting
military discipline, he turned his back upon
his men to see us ride.</p>

<p class="indent">We were now on the old Via Flaminia
and in the valley of the Clitumnus,&mdash;Virgil&#39;s
country. The poet&#39;s smiling fields and tall,
stiff oaks, his white oxen and peasants behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
the plough or enjoying the cool shade, were on
either side. Crossing the fields were many
stony beds of streams, dry at this season, lined
with oaks and chestnuts, under whose shade
women were filling large baskets with acorns
and leaves. The upturned earth was rich and
brown. Through the trees or over them we
saw the whitish-blue sky, the purple mountains,
some pointed like pyramids, and the gray olive
hills with little villages in their hollows, and
before long Trevi on its high hill-top. And
then we came to the temple of the river god
Clitumnus, of which Pliny writes, and where
the little river, in which Virgil says the white
flocks for the sacrifice bathed, runs below, an
old mill on its bank and one willow bending
over it.</p>

<span class="ralign"><i>Page 146.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">At the village of Le Vene, near the source
of the stream, we stopped at a wine-shop to
eat some bread and cheese. There was no
one there but the <i>padrone</i> and a dwarf who
wore a decent suit of black clothes and had a
medallion of the Pope on his watch-chain. He
had come in a carriage which waited for him
at the door. I think he was a drummer. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
drank much wine, and spoke to us in a vile
patois. Indeed, the people thereabout all
spoke in dialects worse, I am sure, than any
Dante heard at the mouth of Hell. The dwarf
had travelled, and had been in Florence, where
he had seen a velocipede, but not like ours. It
was finer, or perhaps he should say more commodious.
The seats were side by side, and it
had an umbrella attached, and it was worked
by the hands. It went, oh, so fast! and he intimated
that we could not hope to rival its speed.
I suppose our machine without an umbrella
seemed to him like a ship without a sail. But
I think he had another tale to tell when, ten
minutes later, he having started before we did,
we passed him on the road. We were going
so fast I only had time to see that in his wonder
the reins fell from his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came the small, wretched village of
San Giacomo, with its old castle built up with
the houses of the poor, and then Spoleto, where
we lunched in a <i>trattoria</i> of the people which
was much troubled by a plague of flies. A
company of Bersaglieri, red caps on the backs
of their heads and blue tassels dangling down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
their backs, sat at one table, ordering with
much merriment their soup and meat and
macaroni to be cooked <i>à la Bersagliere</i>; at
another, two young men were evidently enjoying
an unwonted feast; and at the table with
us were three peasants, one of whom had
brought his bread in his pocket: he eat his
soup for dessert, and throughout the meal used
his own knife in preference to the knife and
fork laid at his place. Two dogs, a cat, and
a hen wandered in from the piazza and dined
on the bits of macaroni dropped by the not
over-careful soldiers. The waiter greeted us
cordially. He too had a machine, he said, but
had never heard of velocipedes with three
wheels. His had but two; the <i>Signore</i> must
see it. And before he would listen to our
order for lunch, he showed J. his bicycle,&mdash;a
bone-shaker. He was very proud of it.
He had ridden as far as Terni. Ah! what
a beautiful time we should have before the
afternoon was over! Seven miles down the
mountain!</p>

<p class="indent">The thought of this coast made us leave
Spoleto with light hearts, though we knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
that first must come a hard climb. But if the
road was as perfect as it had been all the morning,
there was not much to dread. It was
half-past two when we started from the <i>trattoria</i>,
but we were fifteen minutes in walking
to the other end of the town. There was no
use riding. The streets were narrow and steep,
and crowded with stupid men and women and
donkeys, and with officers who instead of controlling
were controlled by their horses. Beyond
the gate the ascent at first was gradual and we
rode easily, even as we worked looking back
to the famous old aqueduct and the shadowy
heights of Norcia. For some distance we went
by the dried-up bed of a wide stream, meeting
many priests on foot and peasants on donkeys.
But as the way became steeper we left the
stream far below, and came into a desolate
country, where the mountains were covered
with scrub-oaks, and priests and peasants disappeared;
only one old man kept before us,
making short cuts up the mountain-side, but
after a while he too rode out of sight.</p>

<p class="indent">We soon gave up riding. J. tied a rope
to the tricycle and pulled while I pushed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
The sun was now hidden behind the mountain
and the way was shady. But still it was
warm work and wearisome; for before long
the road became almost perpendicular and was
full of loose stones. How much more of this
was there, we asked a woman watching swine
on the hillside? &quot;A mile,&quot; was her answer;
and yet she must have known there were at
least three. Finally, after what seemed hours
of toiling, we asked another peasant standing
in front of a lonely farm-house how much
farther it still was to the top. &quot;You are
here now,&quot; she said. She at least was truthful.
A few feet more, and we looked down
a road as precipitous as that up which we
had come, and so winding that we could see
short stretches of it, like so many terraces,
all the way down the mountain. We walked
for about a hundred yards, and it was as hard
to hold back the machine as before it had
been to push it. Then we began to ride, but
the strain on the brake loosened the handle
a second time. We dismounted, and J. tried
to push it back into place: it snapped in
two pieces in his hands. Here we were, eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
miles from Terni, in a lonely mountain road
in the evening,&mdash;the sun had already set,&mdash;with
a brakeless machine, which, if allowed
to start down-hill with its heavy load of two
riders and much baggage, would soon be more
unmanageable than a runaway horse. The
seven miles&#39; coast to which we had looked
forward for days, was to be a walk after all.
Like the King of France and his twenty
thousand men, we had marched up the mountain
that we might march down again. Is it
any wonder that we both lost our tempers,
and that an accident was the smallest evil
we wished the manufacturers of our tricycle?
Because they cared more for lightness than
for strength,&mdash;since record-making is as yet
the chief end of the cycling,&mdash;the necks of
people who ride for pleasure are forsooth to
be risked with impunity!</p>

<p class="indent">However, there was nothing to do but to
walk into Terni. It was very cold, and we
had to put on our heavy coats. Presently the
moon rose above the mountains on our left.
By its light we could see the white road,&mdash;now
provokingly good, but steep and winding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
and all unknown,&mdash;the hills that shut us in on
every side, and, far below, the stream making
its way through the narrow pass. The way
was unpleasantly lonely and silent. Now for
an hour or more we went wearily on without
hearing a sound but our steady tramp; and
now we passed a farm-house within which many
voices were raised in anger, while from the
barn a dog barked savagely upon our coming.
At times we thought we saw in the distance
a castle with tall towers or an old ruin, but
when we drew near we found in its place great
rocks and cliffs of tufa. Once we went through
a small village. The way here was not so steep,
and for a few minutes we rode. Just beyond
the houses three men, driving home a large
white bull, walked in the middle of the road.
J. shouted, that they might give us more space
to pass; but they only laughed, and tried to
set the bull on us with loud cries of <i>Via!</i>
Before the last died away we were walking
again.</p>

<p class="indent">On and on we walked, all the time holding
back the tricycle. But at last we began
to meet more people. Men with carts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
donkeys went by at long intervals, but they
spake never a word, and we too were silent.
Now and then we heard the near tinkling of
cow-bells, and came to olive-gardens, where in
the moonlight the black twisted trunks took
grotesque goblin shapes, and the branches threw
a network of shadows across our path. Then
we came to a railroad, and we knew we were
at the foot of the mountains, and that Terni
was not far off. We were at the end of the
seven miles&#39; coast and could ride again. Two
men just then coming our way, J. asked them
how far we were from the town; but they
stood still and stared for answer. A second
time he asked, and still they were speechless.
&quot;<i>Imbecile!</i>&quot; he cried, and we left them there
dumb and motionless. Not far beyond the
road divided, and on either side were a few
houses. A woman (or a fiend in female form)
sat in front of one. &quot;Which is the way to
Terni?&quot; we asked. She was silent. Once
more we asked. <i>Chi lo sa?</i>&mdash;&quot;Who knows?&quot;&mdash;she
answered. This was more than tired
human nature could endure; J. turned upon
her with a volley of choice Italian abuse. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
conquered her as the prayers of Saint Anthony
vanquished her sister demons. She arose and
meekly showed us the way.</p>

<p class="indent">In another minute the lights of Terni were
in sight. Then we wheeled by a foundry with
great furnace in full blast, by a broad avenue
with rows of gas-jets, to the gates of the city, to
find them shut. There was a second of despair,
but J. was now not to be trifled with,
and he gave a yell of command which was an
effectual &quot;open-sesame.&quot; And so we rode on
through lively streets and piazza to the hotel,
to supper, and to bed!</p>

<p class="indent">I know little of Terni, except that in the
month of October the hotel is so cold that
the waiter comes into the dining-room in the
morning with hat on, and wrapped in overcoat
and muffler, and that there is an excellent
blacksmith in the town; for the next morning,
as soon as J. had had the brake mended, he paid
the bill and loaded the tricycle. The <i>padrone</i>
was surprised at the shortness of our stay.
Did we not know there were waterfalls, and
famous ones too, but three miles distant? We
could not take the time to visit them? Well,
then, at least we must look at their picture;
and he showed us a chromo pasted on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
hotel omnibus. I am afraid he took us for sad
Philistines; but the fear of another kind of
waterfall was still a goad to hurry us onward.
Now we were so near our journey&#39;s end, no
wonder, however great, could have led us from
the straight path.</p>

<span class="i4"><i>I somewhat wondered.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">There was a great <i>festa</i> that day, and
all along the street and out on the country
road we met men and women in holiday
dress carrying baskets and bunches and wreaths
of pink chrysanthemums. In Narni, on the
heights which Martial called inaccessible, men
were lounging in the piazza or playing cards
in the <i>caffè</i>. For the shepherds alone there
was no rest from every-day work. Before we
reached even Narni, but ten miles across the
valley from Terni, we saw several driving their
sheep and goats into the broad meadows.
They wore goat-skin breeches, and by that sign
alone we should have known we were nearing
Rome. We lunched at Narni on coffee and
cakes, for it was the last town through which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
we should pass on that day&#39;s ride. It was here
that Quintus, in its Roman prosperity, stayed so
long that Martial reproached him for his wearisome
delay. Could he come to it now, I doubt
if his friend would have the same reason for
complaint. It did not seem an attractive place,
and when we asked a man about the country
beyond, he said it was &quot;<i>bruto</i>.&quot; We did not
learn till afterwards that this applied to the
people, and not to the country, and that here
we ought to have been briganded.</p>

<p class="indent">We were now high up on the mountain,&mdash;on
one side steep rocks, on the other a deep
precipice. Far below in a narrow valley ran
the little river Nar, and on the bank above it
the railroad. It was not an easy road to travel,
and often the hills were too steep to coast or
to climb. The few farm-houses by the way
were closed, for the peasants had gone to
church. We saw an occasional little gray
town crowning the top of sheer gray cliffs, like
those in Albert Dürer&#39;s pictures, or an old
castle either deserted or else with farm-house
built in its ruins, where peasants leaned over
the battlemented walls. But the only villages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
through which we rode were Otricoli, just before
we descended to the valley of the Tiber,
where we created so great a sensation that
an old woman selling chestnuts&mdash;cooked, I
think, by a previous generation&mdash;was at first
too frightened to wait on us, and Borghetto,
on the other side of the valley, where we
saw in the piazza the stage from Cività Castellana,
in which town we were to spend the
night.</p>

<p class="indent">There were a few people abroad. In the
loneliest part of the mountain an old man in a
donkey-cart kept in front of us on a long upgrade.
Interested in the tricycle, he forgot the
donkey, which gave up a straight for a spiral
course, and monopolized the road. J. angrily
asked its driver which side he meant to take.
But the old man heaped coals of fire on his
head by offering to carry us up in his wagon.
After we left him far behind, we passed two
travellers resting by the wayside. Their bags
lay on the ground, and they looked weary and
worn. They gave us good-day, and where we
were going they of course wanted to know.
They too were bound for Rome, it turned out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
and had come from Bologna. After the two
gentlemen of Bologna, we overtook a group of
merry peasants, coats slung over their shoulders
for no possible reason but the sake of
picturesqueness, and hats adorned with gay
pompons of colored paper and tinsel. One
carried branches of green leaves and red fruit
like cherries, and as we went by he gave us a
branch and wished us a good journey. Next
went by an old woman, who said with a
smile that we could go without horse or donkey,&mdash;a
witticism heard so often it could
no longer make us laugh. And then a little
boy all alone came &quot;piping down the valley
wild.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;<span class="smcap">Piping down the Valley.</span>&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">We went with much content over the plain
by the Tiber, where there were broad grassy
stretches full of sheep and horses, and here and
there the shepherds&#39; gypsy-looking huts. It
was such easy work now, that we eat our chestnuts
as we rode; but beyond the bridge, on
which Sixtus V. and Clement VIII. and Gregory
XIII., in true papal fashion, have left their
names, the hills began again. On we toiled,
beneath shady oaks and by rocky places, until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
we came out on a wide upland. From the
treeless road the meadows rolled far beyond to
high mountains, on whose sloping side the blue
smoke of charcoal-burners curled upward. The
moon already had risen, and in the west the
setting sun filled the sky with glowing amber
light, against which the tired peasants going
home were sharply silhouetted.</p>

<p class="indent">We were glad to see Cività Castellana. One
or two men in answer to our questions had
told us we were close to it, but we did not believe
them. The fields seemed to stretch for
miles before us, and there was not a house or
tower in sight. But suddenly the road turned
and went down-hill, and there below was the
city perched on tufa cliffs, a deep ravine surrounding
it. Two <i>carabinieri</i>, in cocked hats
and folded cloaks like the famous two solitary
horsemen, were setting out on their night
patrol. Vespers were just over in the church
near the bridge, and along the way where
happy little Etruscan schoolboys once whipped
homewards their treacherous schoolmaster, little
Italian boys and girls, let loose from church,
ran after us, torturing us with their shrill cries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
Soon their elders joined them, and we were
closely beset with admirers. The town too
was in a hubbub about us, and in the streets
through which we wheeled, men and women
came from their houses to follow in our train.
At the door of the Albergo, where we were detained
for several minutes, the entire population
collected. We had difficulty in getting a room.
The <i>festa</i>, the <i>padrone</i> said, had brought many
country people into the town, and the inns
were full to overflowing. If J. would go with
him he would see what could be done for us.
The search led them through three houses.
In the mean time I kept guard over the machine.
It was well I did, for once J. had gone
the natives closed upon me. Toddling infants
and gray-haired men, ragged peasants and gorgeous
officers pushed and struggled together
in their desire to see. Every now and then a
stealthy hand was thrust through the crowd
and felt the tire or tried the brake. I turned
from left to right crying, &quot;<i>Guarda! Guarda!</i>&quot;
I lifted exploring hands from the wheels. But
in vain. What was one against so many? A
man sitting in the doorway took pity on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
sad plight. He came out, and with a stick
mowed the people back. Then J. returned,
having found a room in the first house, which
the <i>padrone</i> had thought fit to conceal until
the last.</p>

<h2>A MIDDLING INN.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;The good of the place is before</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>you.&quot;</i></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;But here they tarried and slept.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The Albergo of Cività Castellana was but
a middling inn. The <i>padrone</i>, in English
tweed, high boots, and Derby hat, looked half
cockney, half brigand. His wife wore an elaborate
false front, and much lace about her neck.
But they were far finer than their house. We
were lodged in the garret, in a room the size
of a large closet. The way to it led through
another bed-chamber, long and low, in which
four cots were ranged in a row along the wall.
When we crossed it on the way downstairs to
dinner I devoutly prayed that on our return
four nightcaps would not be nodding on the
pillows. Later in the evening, when we had
dined, we strolled out to the piazza. To see
the life of an Italian town you have only to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
to the <i>caffè</i>. We went to one near the Albergo.
There were two tables in it. We sat at the
smaller, and at the other were four ragged boys
playing cards!</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately we were the first to go to bed in
the garret. All through the night, however,&mdash;for
the mattress was hard and I slept little,&mdash;I
heard loud snores and groans, and the sound
of much tossing to and fro. We rose early in
the morning, but when we opened our door the
cots were empty, though they had not been so

<span class="i4"><i>thereof.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Early as we were, the whole town was
stirring when we came downstairs. But
who ever knew the hour when the people of an
Italian town were not up and abroad? No
sooner did J. bring the tricycle from the stable,
where it had been kept all night, to the Albergo,
than the piazza was again crowded. On
they all came with us, men, women, and children,
hooting and shouting, jumping and dancing
through the vilely paved streets, and finally
sprawling over the walls and on the rocks beyond
the gate.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
There they stayed until we had gone down
the hill over the bridge, crossing the stream at
its foot, and up the hill on the opposite side,
passing from their sight around the first curve.
Soon we were on an upland and now really at
the beginning of the Campagna. The morning
was cold. For many miles we rode through a
champaign gleaming white with frost. But as
the sun rose higher in the heavens, and the
yellow light, which at first was spread over the
sky, faded and left a clear blue expanse above,
the air grew warmer and the frost disappeared.
The road wound on and on between oak woods
and wide cultivated fields, and green grassy
plains which gradually changed into great
sweeps of rolling treeless country, like the
moors. By the roadside were thick bushes of
low green sage and tangled blackberries, and
in places the broad flagstones of the old Flaminian
Way, with weeds and dandelions and
pretty purple flowers growing from the crevices.
Sometimes a paving of smaller stones
stretched all across the road, so that for a
minute or two we were badly shaken, or else,
coming on them suddenly at the foot of a hill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
all but upset. Truly, as has been said, it could
have been no joke for the old Romans to ride.</p>

<p class="indent">To our left rose the great height of Soracte,
not snow-covered as Horace saw it, but bare
and brown save where purple shadows lay.
At first we met numbers of peasants all astride
of donkeys, going towards Cività Castellana,
families riding together and eating as they
went. Later, however, no one passed but an
occasional lonely rider (who in his long cloak
and high-pointed hat looked a genuine Fra
Diavolo), or else sportsmen and their dogs.
It was strange that though we saw many of
the latter, we never once heard the singing or
chirping of birds. There were hillsides and
fields full of large black cattle, or herds of
horses, or flocks of sheep and goats. There
were shepherds, too, sleeping in the shade or
by the roadside, leaning on their staffs or ruling
their flock with rod and rustic word, as in
the days when Poliziano sung. And if there
was no bird&#39;s song to break the silence of the
Campagna, there was instead a loud baaing of
sheep, led by the shrill piercing notes of the
lambs. If it was to such an accompaniment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
that Corydon and Thyrsis sang in rivalry, their
song could have been poetical only in Virgil&#39;s
verse.</p>

<p class="indent">How hard we worked now that our pilgrimage
was almost ended! We scarcely looked
at the little village through which we wheeled,
and where a White Brother was going from
door to door, nor at the ruins which rose here
and there in the hollows and on the slopes of
the hills; and when at last we saw on the horizon
the dome coming up out of the broad undulating
plain, we gave it but a short greeting,
and then hurried on faster than ever. We
would not even go to Castel Nuovo, which lies
a quarter of a mile or so from the road, but eat
our hasty lunch in a <i>trattoria</i> by the wayside,
while a man&mdash;an engineer he said he was&mdash;showed
us drawings he had made on his travels,
and asked about our ride. How brave it
was of the <i>Signora</i> to work! he exclaimed, and
how brave of the <i>Signore</i> to sketch from his
velocipede!</p>

<p class="indent">And after this &quot;the hills their heights began
to lower,&quot; and with feet up we went like the
wind, and every time we looked at the dome it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
seemed larger and more clearly defined against
the sky. But about six miles from Rome our
feet were on the pedals again and we were
working with all our might. Sand and loose
stones covered the road, which grew worse
until, in front of the staring pink quarantine
building, the stones were so many that in
steering out of the way of one we ran over
another, and the jar it gave us loosened the
screw of the luggage-carrier. We were so near
Rome we let it go. This was a mistake. But
a little farther, and the whole thing gave way,
and bags and knapsack rolled in the dust. It
took some fifteen minutes to set it to rights
again; and all the time we stood in the shadeless
road, under a burning sun, for the heat in
the lower plains of the Campagna was as great
as if it were still summer. As the luggage-carrier
was slightly broken, we were afraid to
put too great a strain upon it, and for the rest
of the journey the knapsack went like a small
boy swinging on behind.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Like those other pilgrims, we were much
discouraged because of the way. But at last,
wheeling by pink and white <i>trattorie</i>, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
walls were covered with illustrated bills of fare,
and coming to an open place where street-cars
were coming and going, the Ponte Molle, over
a now yellow Tiber, lay before us, and we were
under the shadow of the dome we from afar
had watched for many hours. Over the bridge
we went with cars and carts, between houses
and gardens and wine-shops, where there was
a discord of many hurdy-gurdies, to the Porta
del Popolo, and so into Rome.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Carabinieri</i> were lounging about the gate,
and carriages were driving to the Pincian; but
we rode on and up the street on the right of
the piazza. When we had gone a short distance
we asked a man at a corner our way to
the Piazza di Spagna. We should have taken
the street to our left, he said, but now we could
reach it by crossing the Corso diagonally. As
we did so we heard a loud <i>sst</i>, <i>sst</i> behind us,
and we saw a <i>gendarme</i> running up the street;
but we went on. When we wheeled into the
Piazza di Spagna, however, a second, almost
breathless, ran out in front of us, and cried,
<i>Aspetti!</i> (&quot;Wait!&quot;) But still we rode. <i>Aspetti!</i>
he cried again, and half drew his sword.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
In a minute we were surrounded. Models
came flying from the Spanish steps; an old
countryman carrying a fish affectionately under
his arm, bootblacks, clerks from the near shops,
young Roman swells,&mdash;all these and many
more gathered about us.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Aspetti!</i>&quot; the <i>gendarme</i> still cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Perchè?</i>&quot; we asked.</p>

<p class="indent">And then his fellow-officer, whom we had
seen on the Corso, came up. &quot;Get down!&quot;
he said, in fierce tones of command.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Perchè?</i>&quot; we asked again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Per Christo!</i>&quot; was his only answer.</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd laughed with glee. Hackmen
shouted their applause. It was ignominious,
perhaps, but the wisest policy, to get down and
walk to our hotel.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p class="center">VETTURINO <i>versus</i> TRICYCLE.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By</span> JOSEPH PENNELL.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From &quot;Outing.&quot;</i></p>

<p class="indent">Who has not journeyed through a country with his
favorite author long before he makes the actual trip
himself? and who, when he comes to see with his
own eyes that at which he has hitherto looked
through some one else&#39;s, does not find himself his
best guide? Long before I came to Italy I had
travelled along its highways and by-ways with many
authors, more especially with Hawthorne in his
&quot;Italian Note-Book,&quot; and Mr. Howells in his
&quot;Italian Journeys&quot; and &quot;Venetian Life.&quot; When
it was finally my good fortune to make the journey
myself, I was at first lucky enough to have for a companion,
not his books, but Mr. Howells himself; and
I frankly confess I found him far more delightful
and satisfactory in person than in print. A year
later I started for the same country, this time encumbered
with a wife and a tricycle. Mr. Howells
could no longer be my <i>cicerone</i>: in the first place
he was back in Boston,&mdash;I might add, as if in parenthesis,
calling me &quot;lucky dog&quot; for being able to
go so soon again over the well-known ground; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
in the second place, because the route I now intended
to take is not described in his books. But it
is in Hawthorne&#39;s &quot;Note-Book,&quot; a volume which, as
I have just said, I had frequently studied. But of
course I forgot to put it in my knapsack, and so had
not a chance to see it until I arrived in Rome. When
I there looked into it, naturally in a more critical
spirit&mdash;inspired by personal knowledge of the subject&mdash;than
I ever had before, the first thing that
struck me was the advantage I had had over my old
master in travelling by tricycle instead of by diligence.
From the little village of Passignano to Rome we
had followed exactly the same road, and though we
began our rides at its opposite ends, I could still
easily compare the time we had made, and the comfort
and convenience and pleasure we had enjoyed
by the way. As this comparison may be interesting
to many who intend some day to make the cycling
tour of Italy, I will here briefly indicate Hawthorne&#39;s
experience, principally as to time and roads, and
then mine:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HAWTHORNE&#39;S JOURNEY
TO FLORENCE.</p>

<p class="center">FIRST DAY OF TRIP.</p>

<p class="indent">We passed through the Porta
del Popolo at about 8 o&#39;clock, and
... began our journey along the
Flaminian Way.... The road
was not particularly picturesque.
The country undulated, but <i>scarcely
rose into hills</i>.... Finally came
to the village of Castel Nuovo di
Porta ... between 12 and 1....
Afternoon, Soracte rose before
us.... The road kept trending
towards the mountain, following
the line of the old Flaminian Way,
which we could see at frequent
intervals close beside the modern
track. It is paved with large flagstones,
laid so accurately together
that it is still, in some places, as
smooth and even as the floor of a
church, and everywhere the tufts
of grass found it difficult to root
themselves into the interstices....
Its course is straighter than that
of the road of to-day.... I forget
where we finally lost it....
Passed through the town of Rignano&mdash;road
still grew more and
more picturesque.... Came in
sight of the high, flat table-land,
on which stands Cività Castellana....
After passing over the bridge,
I alighted with J. and R. and
made the ascent on foot.... At
the top our vetturino took us into
the carriage again, and quickly
brought us to what appears to be
a very good hotel.... After a
splendid dinner we walked out
into the little town, etc.</p>
</td>
<td class="tdlt">
<p class="center">MY NOTES.</p>

<p class="center">LAST DAY OF TRIP.</p>

<p class="indent">We left Cività Castellana at a
quarter of eight. Road so rough,
had to walk down-hill and up again.
(So did Hawthorne&#39;s party.)
Road very picturesque, and, before
long, a distant glimpse of St.
Peter&#39;s. Began to see, and occasionally
to feel, the paving of the
old Flaminian Way, which is abominable.
Made of flagstones thrown
roughly together, or else little
blocks, like the Roman pavement.
Coming on a stretch of it, at the
foot of a hill, and hidden with
dust, smashed our luggage-carrier,
and loosened the machine,&mdash;more
than the whole trip had done.
Passed Rignano,&mdash;usual sensation,&mdash;good
<i>café</i>. Under Soracte
all morning. Reached Castel
Nuovo di Porta at 11. (Distance
to this village from Cività Castellana
much farther than from it
to Rome, yet we reached it one
hour sooner than Hawthorne did,
starting out from Rome.) Road
got worse and worse. Finally
nothing but ruts and stones.
Hills not to be laughed at (though
Hawthorne thought them scarcely
perceptible). Arrived at the Porta
del Popolo about half-past
one. (About three and a half
hours&#39; better time than Hawthorne.)
Distance, thirty-five Italian
miles.</p>

<tr>
<td class="tdlt">
<p class="center">SECOND DAY.</p>

<p class="indent">Roused at 4 o&#39;clock this morning; ...
ready to start between 5
and 6.... Remember nothing particularly
till we came to Borghetto....
After leaving Borghetto, we
crossed the broad valley of the
Tiber.... Otricoli by and by
appeared.... As the road kept
ascending, and as the hills grew
to be mountainous, we had taken
on two additional horses, making
six in all, with a man and boy ...
to keep them in motion....
Murray&#39;s guide-book is exceedingly
vague and unsatisfactory
along this route.... Farther on
[we saw] the gray tower of Narni....
A long, winding street passes
through Narni, broadening at one
point into a market-place; ...
came out from it on the other side....
The road went winding down
into the peaceful vale.... From
Narni to Terni I remember nothing
that need be recorded. Terni,
like so many other towns in the
neighborhood, stands in a high
and commanding position....
We reached it between 11 and 12....
It is worth while to record,
as history of <i>vetturino</i> commissary
customs, that for breakfast we had
coffee, eggs, and bread and butter;
for lunch, an omelette, stewed veal,
figs and grapes, and two decanters
of wine; for dinner an excellent
vermicelli soup, two young fowls
fricasseed, and a hind-quarter of
roast lamb, with fritters, oranges,
and figs, and two more decanters
of wine.</p>
</td>
<td class="tdlt">
<p class="center">OUR SECOND DAY FROM ROME.</p>

<p class="indent">(We never got up at any such
unearthly hours as Hawthorne
indulged in.) Left Terni at 11
o&#39;clock, having been obliged to
get a new brake made. Terni,
dead level, in low valley,&mdash;straight,
wide road, ten miles across the
valley,&mdash;surface of the road good.
Just outside of Narni road climbs
up a steep hill into the town.
(There must have been an earthquake
since Hawthorne&#39;s time, as
Terni, which he saw in a high and
commanding position, now stands
in the lowest part of the valley,
with mountains all around.) From
Narni up nearly all the way to
Otricoli, with the exception of
here and there such a steep descent
that we had to hold the
machine back with all our might,
riding for several hours was almost
impossible. (Wish we had
had six horses, a man, and a boy
to pull us on.) From Otricoli,
down and all across the valley,
excellent riding to Borghetto;
then big hill up, out on to the
Campagna, and up and down&mdash;good
road&mdash;all the way to Cività
Castellana, which we reached between
6 and 7. Terrible sensation!!!
(This day Hawthorne
came in two hours ahead; but he
had six horses and the hills in his
favor.) We eat every day coffee,
bread and butter, and rolls in the
morning; for lunch, a beefsteak,
or macaroni, and fruit, <i>no wine</i>,
but fresh lemons and water; for
dinner, soup, two meats, fruit, and
a <i>fiasco</i> of wine. Distance about
thirty-three Italian miles. (We
carried Baedeker, and not Murray,
and found it not unsatisfactory.)</p>

<td class="tdlt">
<p class="center">THIRD DAY.</p>

<p class="indent">At 6 o&#39;clock this morning ...
we drove out of the city gate
of Terni.... Our way was now
through the vale of Terni....
Soon began to wind among steep
and lofty hills.... Wretched
villages.... At Strettura we
added two oxen to our horses,
and began to ascend the Monte
Somma, which ... is nearly
four thousand feet high where we
crossed it. When we came to
the steepest part of the ascent,
Gaetano <i>allowed us to walk</i>....
We arrived at Spoleto before
noon.... After lunch ... we
found our way up a steep and
narrow street that led us to the
city gate.... Resumed our journey,
emerging from the city into
the classic valley of the Clitumnus....
After passing Le Vene, we
came to the little temple ...
immortalized by Pliny.... I remember
nothing else of the valley
of Clitumnus, except that the beggars
... were well-nigh profane
in the urgency of their petitions.
The city of Terni seems completely
to cover a high peaked
hill.... We reached Foligno in
good season <i>yesterday afternoon</i>.
[This passage really belongs to his
fourth day of travel, but as it
shows at what time of the third
day he reached Foligno, I have
included it with the third.]</p>
</td>
<td class="tdlt">
<p class="center">THIRD DAY.</p>

<p class="indent">Left Assisi about 8. Splendid
coast down into the valley.
Beautiful ride over the undulating
road, past Spello to Foligno, not
stopping in the latter place, excepting
to have accidents wished
us by an old woman we almost ran
over. Then through the beautiful
valley of the Clitumnus&mdash;grand
road&mdash;lovely day and wonderfully
fair country. (We saw no beggars.)
Rode by the little temple spoken
of by Pliny. Ate some bread and
cheese at Le Vene. Reached
Spoleto at one; lunched; then
rode up the steep street, through
the gate at the other end of the
city, and then began a tremendous
climb of six miles over Monte
Somma, most of which we had
to walk. At last had hard work
to push. Coming finally to the
top, found the descent on the
other side even steeper. Where
it was a little less steep, we got
on the machine, put on the brake,
which came off in my hand. Bad
brake was the one defect in our
tandem. Had to walk the rest of
the way. In Strettura, men set
bull on us. (Not quite so pleasant
as Hawthorne&#39;s experience.)
Arrived in Terni at 8 o&#39;clock,
having walked the last few miles
by moonlight,&mdash;about forty miles
all together, of which we walked
fully the last fourteen. (Made in
one day what Hawthorne did in
a day and a half.)</p>

<p class="indent">I have already remarked that it
is still possible to live well in
Italy at no great expense, and that
the high prices charged to <i>forestieri</i>
are artificial, and ought to be
abated.... We left Foligno betimes
in the morning; ... soon
passed the old town of Spello....
By and by we reached Assisi.
We ate our <i>déjeûner</i>, and resumed
our journey.... We soon reached
the Church of St. Mary of the
Angels.... By and by came to
the foot of the high hill on which
stands Perugia, and which is so
long and steep that Gaetano took
a yoke of oxen to aid his horses
in the ascent. We all, except my
wife, walked a part of the way up....

of Perugia (up which Hawthorne
walked). Crossed the
Tiber. Visited Santa Maria degli

in one day, over a road which Italian cyclers have told
me is excellent, and which is the post-road to Rome.
We went by way of Montepulciano and Siena, being
between two and three weeks on the way. I hope
this short account of about one third of our ride will
convince other people that cycling is far quicker
than the old posting system, far pleasanter than
riding in a stuffy railway-carriage, which whirls you
through tunnels, and far the best way in which to
see Italy,&mdash;a country which abounds in magnificent
roads, and which should be thoroughly explored by
all cyclers who care for something beside record-making.</p>
